Even though the family members have each amassed a high net worth since first becoming famous, they don't have an easy time.

According to Just Jared Jr., the cast of Little People, Big World all have fairly high net worths. <strong>Amy Roloff and Matt Roloff have $6 million net worths</strong>. Their children Molly Roloff, Zach Roloff, Jeremy Roloff, and Jacob Roloff all have net worths of $700,000.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Name Of Each Roloff Family Member</p></th><th scope=col><p>Relation (According to People)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Matt Roloff</p></td><td><p>father</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Amy Roloff</p></td><td><p>mother</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zach Roloff</p></td><td><p>son/twin brother to Jeremy</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jeremy Roloff</p></td><td><p>son/twin brother to Zach</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Molly Roloff Silvius</p></td><td><p>daughter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jacob Roloff</p></td><td><p>youngest son</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Matt also said:</p><p>"We don't see Zach and Tori that often.

According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple got engaged in April 2023</a>. Zack didn't appear to be supportive, which hurt Matt's feelings.

She would have made money from the book deals themselves and then likely made money from royalties.</p><p>Jeremy and Zack Roloff also likely earn an income from the podcasts that they have with their wives. Jeremy hosts "These Are The Days" with Audrey and Zack hosts "Raising Heights" with Tori. While the amount that they make is unclear, they are famous enough that they can likely attract advertisers, which could allow them to take home some cash from podcasting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqykobJuvMSop6WdXZe2qHnWqKmlnF2YrrTAjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyfmKahnK56s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flittle-people-big-world-cast-net-worth-family-relationship.html&text=Even%20The%20Little%20People%20Big%20World%20Cast%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Can%27t%20Fix%20Their%20Fractured%20Family%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flittle-people-big-world-cast-net-worth-family-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flittle-people-big-world-cast-net-worth-family-relationship.html&title=Even%20The%20Little%20People%20Big%20World%20Cast%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Can%27t%20Fix%20Their%20Fractured%20Family%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flittle-people-big-world-cast-net-worth-family-relationship.html&title=Even%20The%20Little%20People%20Big%20World%20Cast%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Can%27t%20Fix%20Their%20Fractured%20Family%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flittle-people-big-world-cast-net-worth-family-relationship.html&title=Even%20The%20Little%20People%20Big%20World%20Cast%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Can%27t%20Fix%20Their%20Fractured%20Family%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flittle-people-big-world-cast-net-worth-family-relationship.html&description=Even%20The%20Little%20People%20Big%20World%20Cast%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Can%27t%20Fix%20Their%20Fractured%20Family%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-1259-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hailey Baptiste Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./clam-bake-chowder.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clam Bake Chowder | Rachael Ray Show">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
