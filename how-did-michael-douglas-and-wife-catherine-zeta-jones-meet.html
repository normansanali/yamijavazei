Incredibly popular with viewers of a variety of ages, Wednesday inspired a slew of viral videos and even more discussion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there is no doubt that Wednesday's success revolved around Jenna Ortega's portrayal of the titular character, the show put several other actors in the spotlight as well. A perfect example of that is thanks to <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones joining Wednesday's cast</a>, many fans have been reminded about how talented she is. After all, many <a href=#>fans adore Zeta-Jones' portrayal of Morticia Addams</a>.</p><p>With many fans reacquainting themselves with Zeta-Jones, they have been going back to watch her best movies including Chicago, The Mask of Zorro, Traffic, and High Fidelity. On top of that, there has been more interest in her personal life including the fact that she has been married to Michael Douglas for more than twenty years.</p><p>Of course, long before <a href=#>Douglas and Zeta-Jones celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary</a>, the A-list couple had to meet for the first time. While Zeta-Jones and Douglas clearly fell in love, it turns out that the details about how they first met may have been creepy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas-meet>How Did Catherine Zeta-Jones And Michael Douglas Meet?</h2><p>Ever since Catherine Zeta-Jones first rose to international fame thanks to her role in The Mask of Zorro, she has widely been considered to be one of the most gorgeous stars in the world. With that in mind, it should go without saying that loads of stars would have loved to get involved with her before she walked down the aisle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones Reveals Who Calmed Her Nerves On The Set of ‘Prodigal Son’</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for anyone else who was interested in Zeta-Jones at the time, however, she met the man who is now her husband almost immediately after she rose to fame.</p><p>Widely considered to be one of the most attractive men in the world throughout the '80s and '90s, Michael Douglas also was a huge movie star. For both of those reasons, there were a lot of people who were attracted to Douglas throughout his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas-early-in-their-relationship.jpg><p>During the '80s and early-'90s, however, Douglas was off the market since he was married to Diandra Luker. While Douglas and Luker technically were married until the year 2000, their romantic relationship ended in 1995 when she filed for divorce.</p><p>Since Douglas was single when Zeta-Jones rose to fame once The Mask of Zorro was released in July 1998, that freed him up to pursue her. During a 2016 appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, Douglas spoke about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how he pursued a relationship with Zeta-Jones</a> at that time.</p><p>As Douglas revealed, he found out he was going to be at the same event as Zeta-Jones when she was still attending red carpet events celebrating The Mask of Zorro's release. Since Zeta-Jones had caught Douglas' eye, he had one of his people arrange for them to meet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was over at the Deauville Film Festival and I saw that next night of the festival Catherine was going to be there with Zorro, so I asked the gentleman, my publicist, 'I'd really like to meet her can you find out if I can have a drink with her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas-now.jpg><p>Fortunately for Douglas, Zeta-Jones agreed to his offer to meet up. According to Douglas, by the time Zeta-Jones arrived to spend time with him, he'd already enjoyed a few drinks.</p><p>"So I just finished my whole promotion tour… And she arrived so I was feeling no pain, I was celebrating, I was relaxed."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sharon Stone Revealed She Wasn't Comfortable Around Michael Douglas During Basic Instinct</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not long after they began spending time together, Zeta-Jones had to leave, but Douglas asked her to return and continue their first meeting.</p><p>"I met her in the bar and was a total gentleman then they had to go off and do their work and I said, ‘By chance will you come back if you want to have a nightcap and stuff?'"</p><p>Clearly, Zeta-Jones liked Douglas enough since she agreed to return. Once Zeta-Jones came back to spend more time with Douglas, he said something extremely intense to her.</p><p>"She came back after her work and we sat there for a little while and I said to her after about half an hour, 'You know, I'm going to be the father of your children.'"</p><p>Not long after Douglas said that, Zeta-Jones ended their first night together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It sounded good and she said, 'I've heard a lot about you and I've seen a lot about you and I think it's time that I said goodnight.' And so I thought, 'I totally blew it… I've just destroyed it so I said… 'I've got to get some roses to her' and I couldn't believe it, by the time that Catherine arrived in Mull… they got her some flowers and an apology so yes it worked out OK."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas-golfing-together.jpg><p>Considering that Zeta-Jones and Douglas have been involved ever since that first meeting, he clearly is right that things worked out.</p><p>Still, if Douglas wasn't rich, famous, and good-looking, it is easy to imagine how creepy that story could be. After all, there are a lot of people who'd agree that being told your date was going to impregnate you shortly into your first date would be extremely off-putting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-after-catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas-started-dating>What Happened After Catherine Zeta-Jones And Michael Douglas Started Dating?</h2><p>According to Michael Douglas' own description of his first meeting with his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, she left soon after he claimed she was going to have his babies. With that in mind, people who are unfamiliar with the timeline may assume it took some time for the two actors to become serious about each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Carys Douglas's Secret Personal Life Is Equally Normal As It Is Extremely Lavish</a></span></p><p>In reality, it didn't take very long at all for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas and Zeta-Jones' relationship</a> to go to another level.</p><p>In fact, within months of their first meeting, it was announced that Zeta-Jones was carrying Douglas' child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas-with-their-children.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After they first met in late '98, Zeta-Jones gave birth to Dylan in August 2000, the son she shares with Douglas.
