His story recently stole the spotlight after his partner Haley Slaton appeared for the audition and won the ticket to Hollywood.</p><p>Learn more about Jordan in this article.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Myles On American Idol</strong></h3><p>Jordan Myles was one of the contestants of American Idol who showed up at the audition but left with something more. He met Haley Slaton the person who he is ready to spend the rest of his life with. Along with the golden ticket to Hollywood, he also took home the ticket to a lifetime of happiness.</p><p>He and Haley pursued their relationship and now they have created a family of their own. Read more about it below.</p><h3><strong>Is American Idol Jordan Myles Haley Slaton’s Baby Daddy?</strong></h3><p>No, Jordan Myles is not the baby daddy of Haley Myles. She had her son from a previous relationship based on the timeline of their relationship and the birth of her child.</p><p>Jordan Myles is the husband of American Idol contestant Haley Slaton. According to the report in New York Post, Haley and Jordan met each other during the first round of American Idol October audition in Austin, Texas. When she performed her solo for the panel of A-listers she was five months pregnant.</p><p>It wasn’t long before they got married. They shared their wedding vows on Christmas Eve 2021 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. A month after their marriage, Haley gave birth to her firstborn Jaelyn Amir Myles in January 2022.

I was already pregnant, and he stepped up to be a father, and I couldn’t thank him enough for that.”</p><p>She added further, “We’re very in love, we’re very happy that we met, and I feel like another reason why I was on the show was to meet him.” She gushed about her husband, “That was a great experience — to meet someone that I finally could spend the rest of my life with.”</p><p>In December 2021, Jordan took to his Facebook to share about his new wife. In one part of the post he wrote, “Haley is the funniest, God-fearing, most wonderful woman I have ever met. Marrying her has been the second easiest decision in my life. (Second to accepting Christ.)”</p><p>For many motherhood could mean the end of their dreams or at least a halt for a while. Meanwhile, Haley feels otherwise. She told, “Just being a mom shouldn’t stop you from following your dreams. I just want to do this for my son and give him a really good life. And I want to show him to never stop chasing his dreams in the future. Never give up on your dreams. Mommy went and chased hers.”</p><p>But, Haley and Myles weren’t the only couples American Idol served as a cupid. Gabby Barrett and Cade Foehner were season 16 contestants who met on the program in 2018 and married a year later. In January 2021, they had their first child, Baylah May.</p><p>Furthermore, Maddie Poppe, the season 16 winner, is dating Caleb Lee Hutchinson, the season 16 runner-up.
