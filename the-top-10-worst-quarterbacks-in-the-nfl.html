They are responsible for leading the offense, making split-second decisions, and executing plays. While some quarterbacks excel and become stars, others struggle to find success on the field. In this article, we will explore the top 10 worst quarterbacks in the NFL.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>1. Nathan Peterman</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Nathan Peterman is widely regarded as one of the worst quarterbacks in recent NFL history. During his tenure with the Buffalo Bills, he threw a staggering 12 interceptions in just 130 pass attempts, earning him the nickname "Pick Six Peterman." His poor decision-making and inability to read defenses led to countless turnovers and losses for his team.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>2. Blaine Gabbert</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Blaine Gabbert was a highly-touted prospect coming out of college, but he failed to live up to expectations in the NFL. His lack of accuracy and pocket presence made him a liability for any team he played for. Despite being given several opportunities, Gabbert never managed to establish himself as a reliable starting quarterback.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>3. Josh Rosen</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Josh Rosen was selected in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals, but his career has been marred by inconsistency and poor performance. He has struggled with decision-making and accuracy, leading to turnovers and a lackluster completion percentage. Rosen has since bounced around the league, failing to find a team willing to commit to him as a starter.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>4. Christian Hackenberg</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Christian Hackenberg was a highly-touted prospect coming out of college, but his skills did not translate to the NFL. Lacking accuracy and struggling with decision-making, Hackenberg failed to secure a starting position with any team. He eventually fell out of the league and has yet to make a significant impact in professional football.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>5. Blake Bortles</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Blake Bortles had a few promising seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars, but overall, his performance was underwhelming. He struggled with accuracy and consistency, often making poor decisions under pressure. Despite leading the Jaguars to the AFC Championship Game in 2017, Bortles was unable to maintain a high level of play throughout his career.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>6. Paxton Lynch</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Paxton Lynch was a first-round pick by the Denver Broncos in 2016 but failed to establish himself as a starting quarterback. His lack of accuracy and inability to read defenses led to turnovers and a lack of confidence from his teammates. Lynch was eventually released by the Broncos and has struggled to find a place in the league since then.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>7. EJ Manuel</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>EJ Manuel was selected in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills but failed to meet expectations. He struggled with accuracy and decision-making, often making costly mistakes in critical moments. Manuel was eventually benched and released by the Bills, and his career never recovered.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>8. Ryan Lindley</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ryan Lindley had a brief stint as a starting quarterback in the NFL but proved to be ineffective. His lack of accuracy and inability to read defenses led to a low completion percentage and a high number of interceptions. Lindley was eventually replaced as the starter and failed to secure another starting position in the league.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>9. JaMarcus Russell</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>JaMarcus Russell was the first overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, but his career quickly spiraled downhill. Russell struggled with accuracy, decision-making, and a lack of work ethic. He became known for his poor conditioning and inability to live up to his potential. Russell's career ended prematurely, making him one of the biggest quarterback busts in NFL history.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>10. Tim Tebow</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Tim Tebow had moments of success in the NFL, his overall performance as a quarterback was subpar. He struggled with accuracy and consistency, often relying on his athleticism rather than his passing ability. Tebow's popularity and off-field persona overshadowed his on-field performance, leading to an inflated reputation that didn't match his actual skill set.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The NFL has seen its fair share of underperforming quarterbacks throughout the years. Whether due to poor decision-making, lack of accuracy, or the inability to read defenses, these quarterbacks failed to establish themselves as reliable starters. While some had promising moments, their overall performance and impact on the field left much to be desired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6tn55lpKS9bn2PZq6oqqOperLBwKurnqqSlrCsv4yipWasmJp6r7LL</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-top-10-worst-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html&text=The%20Top%2010%20Worst%20Quarterbacks%20in%20the%20NFL&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-top-10-worst-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-top-10-worst-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html&title=The%20Top%2010%20Worst%20Quarterbacks%20in%20the%20NFL" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-top-10-worst-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html&title=The%20Top%2010%20Worst%20Quarterbacks%20in%20the%20NFL" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-top-10-worst-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html&title=The%20Top%2010%20Worst%20Quarterbacks%20in%20the%20NFL" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-top-10-worst-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html&description=The%20Top%2010%20Worst%20Quarterbacks%20in%20the%20NFL" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tony-bennetts-kids-meet-danny-dae-joanna-and-antonia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Bennett's Kids Danny, Dae, Joanna and Antonia">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sierra-cabot-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sierra Cabot | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
