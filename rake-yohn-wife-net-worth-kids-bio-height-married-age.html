However, the actual figure of his career earning or salary remains unknown to date.</p><p>Known for his gross-out stunts and comedy, Rake rose to fame with MTV’s ‘Jackass’. One of his most unforgettable bits was his ‘Rapunzel’ impression from the ‘Jackass 2.5’. More of a voice-over artist as well, he has used his voice talents for various comedy beyond Jackass, including short-lived ‘Blastazoid’. With all these varied roles, he succeeds in accumulating that 7-figure net worth!</p><p><strong>Quick Info</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong>&nbsp;$1 million</li><li><strong>Salary:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rake-yohn-age-height-and-weight></span>Rake Yohn Age- Height and Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Very thin yet athletic type Rake Yohn has a towering height of 6 feet 3 inches and balanced body weight. But what he’s most well known for is his love for metal, long curly hair, and lean posture.</p><p>While there is nothing wrong with admiring long hair, tattooed body, and really outrageous appearance, it was his days on ‘Jackass’ that took a heck of a toll on Rake’s appearance.</p><p><strong>Quick Info</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Height:</strong>&nbsp;6 feet 2 in (189cm)</li><li><strong>Body Measurements:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Plastic Surgery:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li></ul><p>It looks like the years of heavy boozing/smoking habit, painful/ self-torturing stunts and the stressful professional life has taken it’s on Rake’s aging, as he now looks pale & duller. He will only a few years over 40, but looks like someone in the late 50s!</p><p>Once a good-looking man with a well-groomed hairdo, polished appearance, and, is now an outwardly lean with frizzy hair, appalling presence due to his clothing choice of baggy jeans and loose t-shirts, which literally gives him a sort of dysfunctional look.</p><p>Every so occasionally, Rake pops up in an acting role and continues to make comedy videos for his podcasts. Post-Jackass, Rake is living his life on the down-low and is now a certified chemist. Fans can follow him on his self-titled Twitter account!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rake-yohn-wife-melissa-car-and-kids></span>Rake Yohn Wife- Melissa Car and Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Keeping his private life under wraps, Rake Yohn seldom speaks to the public about his family. Married to the love of his life, Rake spends a fair bit of time away from the limelight, spending time in his Pennsylvania house with his wife and their two children.</p><p>Sure, Rake is passionate about attempting painful stunts and outspoken about what he believes in, but you won’t find him spilling the details of his personal life in any of ‘Jackass’ or ‘Viva La Bam’ episodes.</p><p>Rake, who has stayed in the public eye, but lived out the personal life so relatively private, married his ladylove, Melissa Car in a private ceremony and welcomed two gorgeous children with her.</p><p>The seemingly happy couple has kept their relationship secret on purpose and is currently focusing on their budding family.</p><p><strong>Quick Info</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Parents:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Wife:</strong>&nbsp;Melissa Carr</li><li><strong>Children:</strong>&nbsp;2</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong>&nbsp;Married</li></ul><p>Born Edward Carl Webb in West Chester, Pennsylvania, he later became known by his stage name, Rake Yohn. Growing up in the countryside of the country, he played and sang in the group called ‘Threshing Sledge’ while in school.</p><p>He later attended Penn State University, earning B.S degree in chemistry in 1997, and currently is a chemist specializing in synthetic materials. He has an older brother named Art Webb, an occasional actor on ‘CKY Crew’.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqRoLJuxc6hpWavmZuybrrErWSwp6KptW63yJ2qZpqZpHqpscign61lnZa%2Fs7XEnWSan5Vk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frake-yohn-wife-net-worth-kids-bio-height-married-age.html&text=Rake%20Yohn%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Married%2c%20Age&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frake-yohn-wife-net-worth-kids-bio-height-married-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frake-yohn-wife-net-worth-kids-bio-height-married-age.html&title=Rake%20Yohn%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Married%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frake-yohn-wife-net-worth-kids-bio-height-married-age.html&title=Rake%20Yohn%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Married%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frake-yohn-wife-net-worth-kids-bio-height-married-age.html&title=Rake%20Yohn%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Married%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frake-yohn-wife-net-worth-kids-bio-height-married-age.html&description=Rake%20Yohn%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio%2c%20Height%2c%20Married%2c%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./samantha-brown-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Samantha Brown Wiki, Bio, Parents, Husband, Ethnicity Net Worth &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nrg-ronaldo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nrg Ronaldo Net Worth, Real Name, Earnings, Bio, Height">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
