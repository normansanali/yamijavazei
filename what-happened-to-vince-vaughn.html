He was the star of such classics as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</a> (2004), Wedding Crashers (2005), The Break-Up (2006), and <a href=#>Couples Retreat</a> (2009), to name a handful. And when he wasn’t starring, he stole scenes in cult favorites like <a href=#>Old School</a> (2003) or Starsky and Hutch (2004). It really seemed like the actor was unstoppable, especially when you factor in some of the dramatic supporting roles he took in the 1990s. Vaughn had range and was someone who was going to stick around.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>At least, we thought he was. Vaughn has mostly disappeared from the public eye in the last decade, and it’s happened so gradually that some fans haven’t even noticed. The last culturally relevant release he was part of was the second season of <a href=#>True Detective</a> in 2015, and most people agree that Vaughn was miscast in the role of a hardened gangster. Let’s delve into some of his recent output and determine what happened.</p><h2 id=h-what-makes-vince-vaughn-such-a-notable-name data-injectable=false>What makes Vince Vaughn such a notable name?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-06-214209.png><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>It’s safe to say that comedy is Vaughn’s specialty. He’s proven that he can get laughs with the best of them, and there seems to be a direct correlation between his waning popularity and the popularity of mainstream comedy. Delivery Man (2013) and Unfinished Business (2015) were attempts to recapture the magic of Vaughn’s earlier hits, but neither managed to connect with audiences.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Vaughn, in an attempt to stick with his comedy chops also teamed up once more with <a href=#>Owen Wilson</a> in 2013’s buddy-comedy, <a href=#>The Internship</a>. Not long after that, he contributed as an executive producer and voice actor for the animated comedy, F is for Family, which ran from 2015 to 2021. He also made a handful of appearances in the ever-popular comedy series <a href=#>Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, from 2020 to 2021.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>Queenpins (2021) was the last full-fledged Vaughn comedy, and it bombed, grossing only $1.2 million on a $20 million budget.</p><h2 id=h-when-did-vaughn-change-up-his-acting-repertoire data-injectable=false>When did Vaughn change up his acting repertoire?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vvaughn-2.jpg><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>In an effort to evolve, Vaughn has turned to drama. It’s worked from an artistry standpoint, as the actor has given some of his best-ever performances in films like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hacksaw Ridge</a> (2016), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brawl in Cell Block 99</a> (2017), and Dragged Across Concrete (2018). The problem is these films draw very little attention from casual fans. They are cult releases, destined to connect with particular niches of fans and critics, but doomed with a minuscule box office performance.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>Vaughn’s eclecticism has continued into the 2020s. He gave an intriguing performance in the neo-noir Arkansas (2020) and was surprisingly effective in the coming-of-age drama North Hollywood (2021).</p><h2 id=h-vince-vaughn-s-activities-away-from-acting-might-ve-played-a-role data-injectable=false>Vince Vaughn’s activities away from acting might’ve played a role</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-06-215056.png><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>In 2019, Vaughn was convicted of reckless driving stemming from a <a href=#>2018 arrest on suspicion of drunken driving</a> in California. He was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to undergo a three-month alcohol abuse program, as a result of a no-contest plea deal.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Something else to consider is Vaughn’s political beliefs. The actor is a self-described libertarian, having previously shown support for notable politicians such as Ron Paul and Rand Paul. And he received criticism in 2020 when he was seen casually talking to, and even glad-handing then-President Donald Trump.</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>Many fans took to social media to condemn the actor, which he addressed in an interview <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p>“I think people are more charged than ever about these things, I was raised with the idea that you could have different likes and beliefs and you should respect and defend that in other people, not shout it down. The people you disagree with the most, you should stand up for their right to do that.”</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Whether or not it’s Vaughn’s political lean or his decision to go the indie route, or even a slight run-in with the law is why he’s seemingly, “slipped away” in recent years, remains to be seen. But if you miss the actor and still want to see him dominate the screen, you can always do so. You just have to dig a little further than you’re used to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZq6Zo7CmedWarKCgnmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-vince-vaughn.html&text=What%20happened%20to%20Vince%20Vaughn%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-vince-vaughn.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-vince-vaughn.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Vince%20Vaughn%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-vince-vaughn.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Vince%20Vaughn%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-vince-vaughn.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Vince%20Vaughn%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-vince-vaughn.html&description=What%20happened%20to%20Vince%20Vaughn%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-rinna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Lisa Rinnas Net Worth: Biography, Net Worth &amp;amp; more">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./adele-emotional-concert-interaction-fan-late-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch the Moment Adele Cried Onstage While Honoring a Fan's Late Wife">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
