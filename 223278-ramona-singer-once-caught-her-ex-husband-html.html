News</a> reported that he had been in an extra-marital relationship with another woman for "about a year."</p><p class=Fg>In 2015, Ramona released a memoir titled "<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Ramona-Coaster-Singer/dp/1618688766?tag=amomama07-20">Life on the Ramona Coaster</a>," wherein she shared some details of the split, including how she confronted Mario.</p><p class=Fg>The <a class="Xd a" href=#>RHONY</a> star revealed that one of her friends told her that, during a party, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/ramona-relives-the-moment-mario-confessed-his-affair>Mario was overheard</a> arguing with a woman on his cellphone while he was in the men's bathroom.

Since "Alan" was a family friend, Ramona asked Mario why he hung up instead of giving her the phone so she could say hello to him.</p><p class=Fg>Mario tried to defend himself by claiming that it was a different Alan that Ramona didn't know. However, she was not ready to drop the subject again. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/ramona-relives-the-moment-mario-confessed-his-affair>wrote</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I stood up, and I looked at him. 'Mario, that wasn't a different Alan on the phone, was it? You were talking to a girl just now, weren't you?'"</p><p class=Fg>Ramona described how Mario's expression changed. According to her, it was just as if he had seen a ghost. He looked "like a deer in headlights." She even compared it to when she told him that her water broke when she was pregnant with their daughter, Avery.</p><p class=Fg>At that point, Mario knew that he had been caught. He <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/ramona-relives-the-moment-mario-confessed-his-affair>replied</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"Yes, I was.

Kasey and Mario kept dating even after his and Ramona's highly-publicized breakup and divorce, which was finalized in 2016.</p><p class=Fg>However, in 2018, Mario made headlines again after it was reported that he caught Kasey cheating on him.

She didn't leave, though, so he called the police on her, but the officers considered that Kasey still had residency rights to the property, so she was allowed to stay for that evening.</p><p class=Fg>Later, Kasey had to look for a new place to stay, though, and if she returned, she would have been arrested for trespassing, reported <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2018/02/07/ramona-singers-ex-dumps-and-evicts-cheating-mistress/>Page Six</a>.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>MARIO AND RAMONA SINGER QUARANTINED TOGETHER</strong></p><p class=Fg>Ramona and Mario's ordeal was definitely challenging for every member of the family.

Her doctor then told her that she needed to get out of Aspen.</p><p class=Fg>After talking to Avery, they concluded that the best thing to do was heading to Mario's home in the Hamptons. Initially, Ramona thought that she would star there for only a couple of weeks. As of May 21, she'd been there for ten weeks.</p><p class=Fg>Although they spent a lot of time together, Mario and Ramona Singer <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/07/are-ramona-singer-mario-back-together-2020/>didn't reconcile</a>.
