This subsequently led to his parent's divorce, which automatically gave his mother, Mary Lee, full custody of the children. Cruise was just 11 at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jamie-foxx-lost-out-on-an-oscar-winning-role-in-jerry-maguire-because-he-couldn-t-resist-trying-to-impress-tom-cruise.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jamie Foxx's "Disappointing" Experience With Tom Cruise Changed His Career For The Better</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jamie Foxx blew his Jerry Maguire audition next to Tom Cruise.</span><p>Cruise's dad admitted that the rift between them was fueled by the messy divorce that had rocked their family in its early days when Cruise and his sisters were still kids.</p><p>At a press conversation about his father in 1992, Tom Cruise spoke in a reconciliatory tone when he made a statement admonishing people to forgive those who have offended them, irrespective of the offense, and to take responsibility for their lives because it makes forgiveness easier. The statement had its bearing on what had transpired between him and his father.</p><h2 id=how-tom-cruise-was-deeply-affected-by-his-parents-rsquo-messy-divorce>How Tom Cruise Was Deeply Affected By His Parents’ Messy Divorce</h2><p>Following his parents’ divorce, Tom Cruise had to take on so many roles and responsibilities to assist his mom, Mary Lee, with running the home front.

He attended 15 schools in 14 years and faced lots of bullying for always being the new kid in town. <strong>This led to Cruise suffering from dyslexia</strong>, which had him placed in a remedial class.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2021-04-13_at_4-24-19_pm_480x480.png><p>Tom Cruise equally didn't have experience of what a healthy father-child relationship was with his dad. He attributed all he knew about fatherhood to his Stepdad John South, whom he never liked initially. He revealed:</p><p>In the beginning, I felt threatened by my stepfather. There’s a part of you that’s in love with your mother. But John is such a wise, smart man.
