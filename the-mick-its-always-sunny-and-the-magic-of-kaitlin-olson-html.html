In Deandra “Sweet Dee” Reynolds’ (Kaitlin Olson) daydream, the rest of the Gang is dead (by her own hand) and she’s the star of a sitcom where she plays Mr. Covington, a butler to a wealthy family in a mansion far away from Philly. It lasts less than two minutes and is one of the funniest things the show has ever done.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbmz0cj2yamcn6bjljnb@published data-word-count=172><span style=font-weight:400>With that in mind, it’s easy to see why Fox helped creators Dave and John Chernin (writers of said episode and producers on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sunny</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>) realize their vision in the darkly funny </span><a href=#><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>, which finished its first season last week. Of course, this is not, in the most literal definition, a spin-off. The DNA of Sweet Dee is clearly flowing through Mickey’s veins, with rash decision-making and little to no regard for consequence a driving force. But Mickey is much more confident and prone to empathy – the way one would imagine Sweet Dee would be if she wasn’t constantly being condescended to as a “stupid bitch” by her monstrous family and friends. And despite the similarities, Olson lives and breathes as a completely different person as Mickey, showcasing her ability to turn from hilarious, quick-witted and foul-mouthed shuckster to vulnerably wounded pseudo-matriarch and back again on a dime. It’s actually more of an accomplishment that she can play two such similar characters while never giving us a reason to confuse them.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbmz0cj3yamczrxyguge@published data-word-count=183><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> finds Olson’s Mackenzie “Mickey” Molng relocated from her drinking, drug-ingesting life as little more than a con artist in Rhode Island to a drinking, drug-ingesting life as a guardian to her </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>very</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> wealthy niece and two nephews after their father and mother, Mickey’s sister, flee the country for fear of prosecution of white collar crime. The eldest, Sabrina (Sofia Black-D’elia), has a delicate ego and a constantly fluctuating social standing that fuel her need to challenge Mickey but also begrudgingly accept her help and guidance. Middle child Chip (Thomas Burbusca, continuing his tyrannical reign over every white male 12-16 role in entertainment) oscillates from typical know-it-all, above-it-all spoiled brat to a young adult with a tragic misplaced sense of pride of his family’s now tarnished name and still holds out hope that his parents love him and will return. Rounding out the cast is youngest sibling Ben (Jack Stanton, the show’s not so secret MVP), Alba (a game Carla Jimenez) the family’s housekeeper, and Jimmy Shepherd (Scott MacArthur), Mickey’s unofficial boyfriend, each bringing their own amalgam of heart, naivete, and insanity.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbmz0cj4yamcocwp25tj@published data-word-count=128><span style=font-weight:400>One of the show’s few emotional moments comes at the conclusion of episode 6, “The Master,” where Chip keeps waiting for his parents to call only to get a voicemail (of them having sex and arguing about the contents of each other’s “go bag”) after a butt dial. Sabrina reassures Chip that he doesn’t have to keep waiting for his parents, because he has her. In an act of accepting Sabrina, Chip throws his phone to the feds camped outside the house who immediately get a voicemail from the parents sending their love. </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> earns these moments by having its characters demand satisfaction of their wants and needs by way of a sense of entitlement at first, only to reveal it stemming from sheer emotional frustration later.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbmz0cj5yamcuuqlxr9v@published data-word-count=175><span style=font-weight:400>Early reviews of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> found critics complaining that show wasn’t dark enough. They were, understandably so, comparing it to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sunny,</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and all seemed to hold the opinion that if Olson was going to be playing a version of Sweet Dee, they wanted the version who tricked people into incestuous situations (a plotpoint of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sunny</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>) rather than helping them deal with incestuous situations they’ve found themselves in (a plotpoint of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>). It was a somewhat fair assessment at the beginning (if you think three minors in the hands of a perpetually drunk felon isn’t “dark enough”) but by the end of this season, it seems unfair to expect something from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> that it’s not trying to give. This isn’t a show about five of the most awful people you’d never want to meet tearing each other and everyone around them down in order to get what they believe to be theirs. </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>is about five people making lemonade from lemons pelted at them from a world that thinks it’s better than them.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbmz0cj6yamcccslex4a@published data-word-count=247><span style=font-weight:400>In recent years, comedy has been going in a new direction: instead of uprooting a character from a show, have the actor simply play a very similar character in a new setting. With the sheer amount of talent out there and the ease of its availability, comedic actors have been forced to carve out a very specific niche for themselves and are rarely trusted to break out of that shell. By never playing against type, we more often than not find ourselves referring to characters in film and television by the actor’s name rather than the character’s. In lieu of having a character’s history and quirks built up over several years before getting their own show, they are now being built </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>into</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> the actor’s performance. Characters are no longer spunoff, actors’ performances are, and it’s this high-wire act that Olson, the producers, and writers perfect throughout the first season. Considering more than a few of the staff are </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sunny</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> alums (Olson, the Chernin brothers, and executive producer Randall Einhorn), there’s every reason to believe that when breaking the plot of any given episode there would be talk of how Sweet Dee vs. Mickey would react. Free of the four albatross around her neck as Dee, Mickey is allowed to dive, headfirst, into every impulse. And, despite herself, she often accomplishes her ever-changing goal, though usually in a roundabout way. One of the core differences between </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sunny</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> is you don’t feel bad rooting for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>’s characters.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbmz0cj7yamcjaq5hrls@published data-word-count=117><span style=font-weight:400>One of the most emblematic scenes of this is the ending of episode 14, “The Heater,” where the characters agree there isn’t really a lesson to be gleaned from Mickey’s gambling addiction. That despite her treatment of Alba, which includes theft of more money than Alba’s ever possessed then getting her kicked out of the casino, everything ends up okay because Aunt Mickey hit a hot streak after losing all but one $5 chip and won all their money back and then some. Nothing is learned, selfishness is rewarded, and there are no emotional consequences, since Mickey then uses a small part of the money to fix Ben’s science project, which she destroyed in the first place.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbmz0cj8yamc7ek0ose7@published data-word-count=169><span style=font-weight:400>This season’s finale ended on a cliffhanger, with the parents finally arrested, the money gone, and Mickey, along with the kids and Alba, standing in shock as the family mansion burns down. When the show returns for another </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>13-episode run this fall</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, it really could be anything. In typical </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> fashion, everything may just return to “normal” with the family simply living in a new mansion paid for by a secret trust fund or offshore accounts that have simply never been mentioned. But here’s hoping the show adopts a new concept (after a year of Mickey adjusting to their lifestyle, perhaps a year of the children adjusting to hers?). Not that there’s anything wrong with what the show has done, but it would be interesting to watch </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Mick</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> change into a completely new and different animal, a different arc for each season to hang its stories on. Either way, there will still be twice as much Kaitlin Olson on our televisions, and that is always a good thing.</span></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>‘The Mick,’ ‘It’s Always Sunny,’ and the Magic of […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocGdgany1tMRmpKKbm2K2tb%2BMmqOwmamoerTBzaewZpmemXq1tMRmpJqfmZh6sLKMpJiirJyeu267y6ymp2aYqbqt</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-mick-its-always-sunny-and-the-magic-of-kaitlin-olson-html.html&text=The%20Mick%2c%20Its%20Always%20Sunny%2c%20and%20the%20Magic%20of%20Kaitlin%20Olson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-mick-its-always-sunny-and-the-magic-of-kaitlin-olson-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-mick-its-always-sunny-and-the-magic-of-kaitlin-olson-html.html&title=The%20Mick%2c%20Its%20Always%20Sunny%2c%20and%20the%20Magic%20of%20Kaitlin%20Olson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-mick-its-always-sunny-and-the-magic-of-kaitlin-olson-html.html&title=The%20Mick%2c%20Its%20Always%20Sunny%2c%20and%20the%20Magic%20of%20Kaitlin%20Olson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-mick-its-always-sunny-and-the-magic-of-kaitlin-olson-html.html&title=The%20Mick%2c%20Its%20Always%20Sunny%2c%20and%20the%20Magic%20of%20Kaitlin%20Olson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-mick-its-always-sunny-and-the-magic-of-kaitlin-olson-html.html&description=The%20Mick%2c%20Its%20Always%20Sunny%2c%20and%20the%20Magic%20of%20Kaitlin%20Olson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ty-law-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ty Law - Bio, Age, net worth, height, Wiki, Facts and Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./strawberry-banana-smoothie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Strawberry Banana Smoothie  Modern Honey">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
