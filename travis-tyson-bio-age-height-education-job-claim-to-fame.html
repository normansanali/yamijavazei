Keep reading this Travis Tyson Bio to learn all about him.</span></p><h3><b>Travis Tyson On Claim To Fame</b></h3><p><span>ABC’s </span><i><span>Claim to Fame</span></i><span> returned for its second installment on June 26, 2023.</span></p><p><span>The reality competition series, hosted by Kevin and Franklin Jonas, saw 12 contestants — each of whom had a famous relative — move into a house together to try and discern which celebrities the other participants were related to. Obviously, the goal was to keep their own celebrity relationship a secret whilst sharing two truths and a lie about them.</span></p><p><span>Our star, Travis claimed his celebrity relative was his actor father with a Critics Choice Award. He even dropped the hint that this sister took carpet photos of him with famous female celebrities alongside his father. As if that wasn’t enough, during a talent show portion of the premiere, Travis recited a long stream of numbers in the mathematical Pi — which was a major clue about who his father might be. Ironically, he won that challenge and was therefore protected at the Guess-Off and given an extra clue.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Hugo and JR came in last place, and Hugo was elected the season’s first Guesser. At the Guess-Off, Hugo then chose to target Carly and correctly guessed that she is Tom Hanks’s niece. Thus, Carly bid a tearful goodbye to the rest of the contestants whilst making sure to let Hugo know that she was upset he had targeted her.</span></p><p><span>“I helped you, Hugo. F</span><span>ricken helped you. I gave you clues, and if any of them are right, I swear I hope you go home because of that,” she shouted at him before storming into the mansion screaming about how the clues had been too obvious.</span></p><p><span>Outside the show, she regretted, “I really wished I used my Aunt Rita as my celebrity relative. That would have made it so much harder to guess.”</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Travis Tyson Famous Relative?</b></h3><p><span>Travis Tyson is the son of the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. So, he wasn’t lying when he said that his sister took pictures of him on the red carpet. Also, Neil indeed was nominated for Critics’ Choice Award in 2014 for his show </span><i><span>Cosmos</span></i><span>. Guess, Travis just bent the truth a little on that part.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about his family, Travis’ mother is a Mathematical Physicist named Alice Young. She met Neil at the </span><i><span>University of Texas</span></i><span>, Austin. However, their connection wasn’t instant. “He was a back-of-the-classroom kind of guy, and I was definitely front-row,” Alice said. But this is a talk for another day.</span></p><p><span>Born in Oct 1956, Alice Young earned her undergraduate degree in physics from </span><i><span>Rice University</span></i><span> and got her Ph.D. in mathematical physics from the</span><i><span> University of Texas</span></i><span>. She then went on to work as an IT manager for </span><i><span>Bloomberg LLC</span></i><span> in New York and married Neil in 1988.</span></p><p><span>As for Travis’s sister, Miranda Tyson was born in August 1996. She’s close to her father and together, they’ve also graced the premiere of </span><i><span>Cosmos</span></i><span> back in October 2014.</span></p><h3><b>Travis Tyson Age</b></h3><p><span><i>Claim to Fame </i>star, Travis Tyson was reportedly born in 2000. That made him 23 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Claim to Fame</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><h3><b>Travis Tyson Height</b></h3><p><span>Travis Tyson stands tall at a height of above 5 feet (152 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Is Travis Tyson Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Travis Tyson was private about his dating life. It could be that he learned from his father to keep things under wraps to avoid any allegations or scandals.</span></p><p><span>In case you don’t know, one of Neil’s classmates accused him of having drugged and raped her while they were in graduate school. But the astrophysicist said that while the two of them dated briefly, he never assaulted her.</span></p><h3><b>Travis Tyson Education</b></h3><p><span>Travis Tyson graduated from </span><i><span>Stuyvesant High School </span></i><span>in 2018 and joined </span><i><span>New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study</span></i><span>. He graduated four years later in 2022.</span></p><p><span>His major, however, has yet to be confirmed.</span></p><h3><b>Travis Tyson Job</b></h3><p><span>Travis Tyson kept his private life under wraps as he joined </span><i><span>Claim to Fame</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>For now, all we can tell is that the son of the astrophysicist is happy making red-carpet appearances with his dad. Travis even accompanied his parents to the New York premiere of the 2016 film </span><i><span>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Also, </span><i><span>Family Feud</span></i><span> fans may remember him from when he graced the show with his father, mother, sister, and his father’s cousin, Monique Fortune, in July 2017.</span></p><p><span>Travis was the first to take on Fast Money. He scored 142 points there.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Travis Tyson Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Travis didn’t reveal his birthday.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Does Travis Tyson Reside?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Travis likely resided in New York, NY.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Travis Tyson On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>In June 2023, Travis was on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>travisty.son</span></a><span> with 248 followers.</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, he had yet to make a post then.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmraqRq7a0edOyqqimXZe2sHnAoJxmoJWetKnAjJ6brpuRqbawuoyjpptlk6GuqrmMraZmnpGisnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftravis-tyson-bio-age-height-education-job-claim-to-fame.html&text=Get%20To%20Know%20Travis%20Tyson%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Education%2c%20Claim%20To%20Fame&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-tyson-bio-age-height-education-job-claim-to-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-tyson-bio-age-height-education-job-claim-to-fame.html&title=Get%20To%20Know%20Travis%20Tyson%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Education%2c%20Claim%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftravis-tyson-bio-age-height-education-job-claim-to-fame.html&title=Get%20To%20Know%20Travis%20Tyson%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Education%2c%20Claim%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-tyson-bio-age-height-education-job-claim-to-fame.html&title=Get%20To%20Know%20Travis%20Tyson%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Education%2c%20Claim%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-tyson-bio-age-height-education-job-claim-to-fame.html&description=Get%20To%20Know%20Travis%20Tyson%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Education%2c%20Claim%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./has-greg-bedard-lost-his-weight-boston-sports-journal-owner-health-condition-today-369097-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Has Greg Bedard Lost His Weight?
