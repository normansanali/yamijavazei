Viewers have enjoyed following Robbie on his struggle to accept his sexuality over the years; last week on the show, he even performed a famous drag makeover.</p><p>Robbie told the Tab, “Sharing my coming out journey was a defining moment in terms of my confidence.

I am happy to be a flamboyant, fabulous, gay man, that I always knew I was underneath.”</p><p>According to IMDB, Robbie has appeared in a total of 38 episodes from 2021 to 2023.</p><p>In one episode, Robbie shared that he lost one of his family members to HIV.

But it seems that Joel is getting a bit put off.”</p><p>The three-way relationship also includes newcomer Geronimo Mörtl. Joel tells Grazia, “Robbie and I are exploring what consensual non-monogamy looks like and we’re dipping our toes into what an open relationship might look like for us.

My mum must’ve immediately realized her mistake. She must’ve called my father. He came home early and gave me the biggest hug and said that it must’ve taken a lot of courage to have said that and that he was proud.”</p><p>Robbie confessed to The Tab that he initially talked to his parents after coming out to his buddies. “My dad was also very accepting,” he said. “I am eternally grateful to be surrounded by such supportive people.”</p><p>Robbie has expressed his gratitude for his parents’ support and said that their reaction to his being gay has inspired other people to do the same.</p><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW51226525 BCX4">“I was quite blessed to have received a wonderful message on Instagram,” he told The Tab. “It was from a viewer who came out to everyone but their father. </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW51226525 BCX4">Upon hearing my story about how well my father received the news and how accepting he was, this person said that they came out to their Dad after ten years of hiding, b</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW51226525 BCX4">ecause of my scene.
