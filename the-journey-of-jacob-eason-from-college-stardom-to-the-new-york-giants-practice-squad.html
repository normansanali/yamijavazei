From being a highly recruited high school player to his college days at Washington and Georgia, and finally joining the NFL, Eason's path has been filled with twists and turns. In this article, we will explore what happened to Jacob Eason, including his decision to forgo his senior season, his draft journey, and his recent signing with the New York Giants' practice squad.</p><p>Jacob Eason's college football journey began at the University of Georgia, where he was highly recruited as the best pro-style quarterback in his class. However, he later transferred to the University of Washington in 2018, seeking more playing time and a fresh start. Eason showcased his skills and potential during his time at Washington, earning recognition as a promising quarterback.</p><p>After the 2019 season, Eason made the decision to forgo his senior season at Washington and enter the NFL Draft. In 2020, he was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts, who saw his potential and believed in his abilities. Eason joined the Colts' roster as a backup quarterback, learning from experienced players and honing his skills.</p><p>Fast forward to the 2023 season, and Eason finds himself as a member of the New York Giants' practice squad. This opportunity arose due to the season-ending injury of the Giants' starting quarterback, Daniel Jones, and the additional injury to Tyrod Taylor. With a 2-7 record, the Giants seem to be embracing the possibility of a lost season and aiming for a top-five draft pick.</p><p>Joining the practice squad provides Eason with a chance to continue his development and showcase his talent to the Giants' coaching staff. While not on the active roster, practice squad players participate in team practices and can be called up to the active roster if needed. Eason's presence on the practice squad demonstrates the Giants' confidence in his potential as a quarterback.</p><p>The current quarterback options for the Giants, excluding Eason, have struggled in their NFL careers, with a combined total of 12 touchdowns and 26 interceptions. This suggests that Eason may have an opportunity to compete for a starting role in the future, depending on his performance and the team's evaluation of his potential.</p><p>Jacob Eason's journey from college football to the NFL has been marked by ups and downs. After a successful college career and being drafted by the Indianapolis Colts, Eason finds himself on the New York Giants' practice squad. While it may seem like a setback, this opportunity provides him with a chance to continue his development and prove his worth to the Giants' coaching staff. Only time will tell what the future holds for Jacob Eason, but his determination and talent make him a player to watch in the NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6tn55lmqTCs7rEsmSonl2frqS7wWacmqufo3qnvs6mZJynnKGyqLGMrKuaqpSkum7AzmaroZ1do7K4edioqaRll56ur8DSZqermZOptqSxjKyorpmU</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-journey-of-jacob-eason-from-college-stardom-to-the-new-york-giants-practice-squad.html&text=The%20Journey%20of%20Jacob%20Eason%3a%20From%20College%20Stardom%20to%20the%20New%20York%20Giants%27%20Practice%20Squad&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-journey-of-jacob-eason-from-college-stardom-to-the-new-york-giants-practice-squad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-journey-of-jacob-eason-from-college-stardom-to-the-new-york-giants-practice-squad.html&title=The%20Journey%20of%20Jacob%20Eason%3a%20From%20College%20Stardom%20to%20the%20New%20York%20Giants%27%20Practice%20Squad" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-journey-of-jacob-eason-from-college-stardom-to-the-new-york-giants-practice-squad.html&title=The%20Journey%20of%20Jacob%20Eason%3a%20From%20College%20Stardom%20to%20the%20New%20York%20Giants%27%20Practice%20Squad" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-journey-of-jacob-eason-from-college-stardom-to-the-new-york-giants-practice-squad.html&title=The%20Journey%20of%20Jacob%20Eason%3a%20From%20College%20Stardom%20to%20the%20New%20York%20Giants%27%20Practice%20Squad" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-journey-of-jacob-eason-from-college-stardom-to-the-new-york-giants-practice-squad.html&description=The%20Journey%20of%20Jacob%20Eason%3a%20From%20College%20Stardom%20to%20the%20New%20York%20Giants%27%20Practice%20Squad" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiktoks-sassy-man-apocalypse-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikToks Sassy Man Apocalypse, explained">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-4-life-lessons-in-villainy-kang-needs-to-learn-from-gravik-in-secret-invasion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 4 life lessons in villainy Kang needs to learn from Gravik in Secret Invasion">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
