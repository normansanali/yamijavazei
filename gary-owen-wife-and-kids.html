Well thankfully, stand-up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Owen</a> is here to lift our spirits with his latest comedy special.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you tune into the 45-year-old’s hour-long set titled #DoinWhatIDo on Sept. 7, here’s what you should know about the Ohio native and the people he frequently cracks jokes about (aka his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wife and kids</a>).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gary Owen and wife of 15 years, Kenya Duke, have three kids.</h2><p>The comedian frequently brings up the fact that he’s in an interracial marriage during his stand-up routines. The family’s short-lived reality show on BET even used the tagline: "Half black. Half white. Half hour."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The longtime couple first crossed paths at a comedy venue in L.A. The show that night featured black comics — and Gary Owen. "He was the only white guy that went up and he followed Cedric the Entertainer… Everybody stood up and gave him a standing ovation," Kenya recalled.&nbsp;</p><p>But when the brunette beauty returned to the club with a group of friends, she wasn’t as impressed with her future husband’s performance. "I said, 'Hey, I saw you last week and you were so funny, but this week you sucked,'" Kenya remembered.&nbsp;</p><p>That didn't stop the budding entrepreneur from giving Gary her phone number. He called the same day. "She goes, 'What are you doing? You’re already calling me?' I said, 'I know I’m supposed to wait three days, but you’re gonna meet a lot of dudes in three days,'" Gary recounted. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>The duo tied the knot in 2003 and Gary took on the role of stepfather to Kenya’s son Emilio from a previous marriage. The pair went on to welcome son Austin and daughter Kennedy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gary recently accused Delta Airlines of racial discrimination after an incident involving his wife.</h2><p>In a March <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>, Gary claimed that a Delta employee racially profiled Kenya while she waited to board a flight from Cincinnati to San Francisco. "Your gate agent asked my wife as she was standing in the priority line if she was in first class," the Ride Along star explained.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"She said yes. My wife is a black woman. So she asks your agent are you not going to ask the man behind me if he is in first? Your agent said NO. My wife asked why? Your agent said 'because I don’t want to,'" Gary continued. "Your ticket agent was a white man, the man standing behind my wife was a white man."</p><p>He added, "I have well over 2 million miles on Delta. I know you have a lot of amazing employees that treat [people] with respect & dignity. But what happened this morning was not OK."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The airline <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement</a> shortly after Gary’s post went viral: "Delta does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.
