Their large family was one that was talked about quite a bit. Among the topics of discussion was their daughter Shiloh.

The emotional interview saw Pitt discussing the end of the marriage and his hopes to improve himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For starters, Pitt revealed that he was in therapy. This is something he said he would've sought even if his marriage with Jolie worked out.</p><p>"You know, I just started therapy. I love it, I love it. I went through two therapists to get to the right one," Pitt said. "I think it would have come knocking, no matter what."</p><p>Pitt did the interview in the home he once shared with Jolie and the kids. He opened up about how difficult it was to be there when the split was still fresh.</p><p>"It was too sad to be here at first," he said. "So I went and stayed on a friend's floor [in] a little bungalow in Santa Monica."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar49058943.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pitt even shared some things he's learned about himself and what he believes are limitations in his ability to express himself.</p><p>"Any of my foibles are born from my own hubris. Always, always. Anytime. I famously step in s*** -- at least for me it seems pretty epic. I often wind up with a smelly foot in my mouth," he admitted. "I often say the wrong thing, often in the wrong place and time. Often."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Won’t Introduce Girlfriend Ines De Ramone To His Kids As He Fears Angelina Jolie Is Spreading Lies</a></span></p><p>Pitt said he felt he was better at expressing himself "in some other art form" like acting and filmmaking, but said he was "trying to get better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street," Pitt said.

She opened up about how her children have grown and how they inspire her.</p><p>"They're pretty great people," she said, "and because there's so many of them, I think they've had a very significant effect on each other. It's not like I'm the head of anything. I'm very honest with my kids. And I'm very human with my kids."</p><p>Jolie said she is "curious about all the different aspects of who they are" when raising her kids, and her top priority is to "be there to support and develop all the different aspects of who they are."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar49095393.jpg><p>"I have six very individual human beings in my home. I am so excited about all the different stages and feelings and curiosities that they go through. Why wouldn't you be?" she said. "We're supposed to help them figure out who they are. And you can't figure out who they are if you don't enthusiastically develop with them."</p><p>Jolie did admit to being tough on herself when it came to parenting.</p><p>"I'm not a perfect parent by any means," she said. "Every day I feel like I'm more aware of everything I don't do right. And I'm pretty tough on myself, because I feel often, 'Am I doing the right thing?

They talk about their loved ones or their regrets," Pitt said. "I say that as someone who’s let the work take me away."</p><p>He continued, "Kids are so delicate. They absorb everything. They need to have their hand held and things explained. They need to be listened to. When I get in that busy work mode, I’m not hearing.
