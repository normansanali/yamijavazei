Giving birth at home has several perks: some women find it easier to relax in the safety of their own homes and find too much medical intervention to be unnerving. In the times of the pandemic, women can't be accompanied by anybody but their partners, which also doesn't sit well with everyone. Some celebrities liked the experience so much they chose to have all their children at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Make Being A Dad Look Good" href=#>10 Celebs Who Make Being A Dad Look Good</a></span></p><p>Most A-listers chose water birth and they had a midwife and sometimes a doula there with them. None of them reported any serious complications, so there was no need for a doctor to be there.</p><h2 id=mayim-bialik><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mayim Bialik</span></h2><p>In 2011, the 'Big Bang Theory' star wrote a piece for <a href=#>Today </a>in which she explained why women shouldn't be afraid of the notion of home birth, explaining that "our culture has instilled in us a fear of the natural experience of birth and a fear of our bodies." She advocates for medication-free birth.</p><p>She has two children, <span class="Eq0J8 LrzXr kno-fv">Frederick Heschel Bialik Stone and Miles Roosevelt Bialik Stone, with Michael Stone. The older one was right there when the younger one was born. Bialik and Stone were married for 10 years and <a href=#>divorced </a>in 2013.

When recalling the birth of her daughter Onyx, she said that it was beyond pain, even going as far as describing it as Tecas Chainsaw Massacre, according to <a href=#>People</a>. She considers her home her sanctuary, so it made sense that she welcomes her babies to the world right there and nowhere else.</p><p>The "Ironic" singer has always been very outspoken about the realities of pregnancy and giving birth. She also spoke up about post-partum depression, a condition many women suffer from, including herself.</p><h2 id=julianne-moore><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Julianne Moore</span></h2><p>Julianne Moore gave birth to her daughter <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn c3biWd"><span class=hgKElc>Liv Freundlich nearly nineteen years ago, back when home births were still very rare. The 'Still Alice' star was 41 years old at a time and Liv is her second child. </span></span>She also has a son, Caleb, who was born in 1997.</p><p>Many <a href=#>A-listers chose to have children after the age of 40</a>, but not all of them choose home birth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pamela-anderson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Pamela Anderson</span></h2><p>Pamela Anderson's private life was always eventful. She is one of those <a href=#>celebrities who married the same person twice</a>, and was married to three extra people on top of that. She has two children with her first husband, Tommy Lee, with whom she was married for three years.</p><p>Both of her sons were born in the comfort of Anderson's home. She chose water birth and had two midwives helping her through the process.</p><h2 id=gisele-bundchen><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gisele Bundchen</span></h2><p>The stunning model has two children. Benjamin was born in 2010 and Vivian two years later.

She married the father of her children, <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>, in 2009.

She went from being one of the most famous pop stars in the world to focusing on her family instead.</p><p>Nelly Furtado gave birth to her daughter Nevis Chetan in September 2003 and she also chose to deliver her at home.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Gigi Hadid</span></h2><p><a href=#>Gigi Hadid and Zayn</a> welcomed their first baby in September 2020. They named their baby Khai and rumors have it that <a href=#>Taylor Swift is going to be her godmother</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Gigi Hadid's 10 Best Steet Fashion Looks" href=#>Gigi Hadid's 10 Best Steet Fashion Looks</a></span></p><p>The reason she chose home birth over going to the hospital is that Gigi wanted her sister and mother to be there with her when the new family member arrived. Because of the pandemic, Gigi wouldn't be able to bring her family along. Gigi gave birth with the help of a midwife and her assistant without epidural.</p><h2 id=lisa-bonet><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lisa Bonet</span></h2><p>Lisa Bonet aka Lilakoi Moon has three children, one of which is famous herself, <span class=aCOpRe>ZoÃ« Kravitz</span>.

According to <a href=#>Essential Baby</a>, she is terrified of hospitals, so it made more sense to have her babies at home.</p><p>"We had the option of having a doctor there, but even he said you'll only need me if you need to be transferred to the hospital - which thankfully, I did not need." She gave birth with a doula and a midwife by her side.</p><h2 id=cindy-crawford><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cindy Crawford</span></h2><p>Cindy Crawford had three midwives there with her when she gave birth to her children, Presley and Gaia. Even though many people warned her about the dangers of home birth, she wasn't discouraged.
