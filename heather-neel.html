She gathered the limelight of her life after marrying NFL star who played as a quarterback for the <i>Oakland Raiders</i>.</p><p>The celebrity wife, Heather, was born on 3 January 1990, in Northern California, the USA, under the birth sign, Capricorn. Likewise, her ethnicity is white, and her nationality is American. Currently, she is thirty-years-old. If you are interested to know more about the married life of Heather, then read the article until the end.</p><h2>Married Life With Derek Carr</h2><p>Heather is currently a married woman as she is happily living with her long-time boyfriend. The wonderful duo walked down the aisle on 29 June 2012; the reverend pronounced them as husband and wife in front of their close friends and families.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/derek%20heather-1565265082080%20(1)-1577695160529.jpg><p>Well, the two first met at a BJ's Brewhouse, where she used to work as a waitress. At that time, she was working there to support herself in her studies. While working, she met Carr, who was a customer at that time. Within a couple of meeting the duo started dating each other and rest is history.</p><p>As of now, the couple is living happily without divorce rumors and controversies regarding their love life. It has been seven years of their successful marriage, and the couple is now proud parents of three.</p><h2>From Weird Pick Up Line To Married Couple</h2><p>On their first meeting, Carr asked her why she only had one earring on even though she has two on. She checked her ear quickly and realized two of them on her ear. At that time, Derek was picking her up, and she was like, "that's your pick up line?"</p><p>Heather shared her precious story in an interview with <i>ABC7</i>. Fortunately, the pickup line worked, and the pair started talking and eventually fell in love and wedded. Besides, she is also the one who changed partying Derek to decent Derek.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/6e974161c5cce7120bac745c9c45ef92-1577695250113.jpg><p>When the two were in a relationship, Derek was a partying guy and often went to the party, which she does not like. Later, she wrote a letter to him, which said that Derek presented himself differently from real Derek. So, if he wanted her to stay, then he had to fix that immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Carr said,</p><p>"Heather wrote me a letter, and she said, 'You're not the person that I thought you were.' I read that, and I remember I stood up in front of my teammates, and I told them, 'Hey, I've been telling you I'm a Christian, and I've been living the party life and all that. And that's dead wrong.' And that's kind of when I got my thing right,"</p><p>For now, he left his bad habits, as Heather said, and now they are in a happy relationship.</p><h2>Shares Three Kids From Their Marital Life</h2><p>They are enjoying their 7th anniversary and also loving their parenthood as they are the parents of their three children. They welcomed their first child, a son named <strong>Dallas Carr, </strong>on<i> </i>5 August 2013, who is currently six years old.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/73480781_107075000598809_5276177576073393566_n%20(1)-1577695399412.jpg><p>Unfortunately, he was born with tied up intestines, which took three medical <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>surgery</strong></a> to get it correct. Heather gave birth to their second child, a son named <strong>Deker Luke</strong>, on 16 March 2016, and he is three years old as of now.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the lovely couple welcomed the third member in their family, whom they named <strong>Deakon Derek Carr</strong>. He was born on 16 May 2019, and he is just six months old.</p><p>Reportedly, Heather uploaded a picture of their children and wished everyone a warm "Merry Christmas."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/76995365_585147382270970_1313047074947915309_n-1577695313732.jpg><p>She often uploads pictures of her family on her Instagram account, where she has over 45 thousand followers. Likewise, Derek also shares photos of her wife and children on his Instagram from time to time.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Heather Neel</h2><p>Currently, Heather is not active in money-making activities as per sources. For now, she is looking after her newborn baby and her other children. So, we can tell her a housewife as of now and does not involve in any profession.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in the days, she was a waitress and earned well from it, which she spent on studies. Heather's net worth is estimated at around <strong>$100,000</strong> as of 2019. Apart from her earnings, her husband, Derek's net worth, is about <strong>$125 Million</strong> as of 2019, which he earns through his successful career as an NFL player.&nbsp;</p><p>He received<strong> $2.2 Million</strong> from his first contract with <i>Oakland Riders</i>. Likewise, he was placed at the 19th position of top NFL player earnings in 2018, with revenues of <strong>$42.1 Million</strong>. Furthermore, he also has endorsements deals with <i>Nike </i>and <i>Panini</i>, which means he must be earning well from it as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/51694851_122731968853524_4871864952097676678_n-1577695470239.jpg><p>Furthermore, his fellow famous NFL player <a href=#><strong>Nate Newton</strong></a><strong>'s</strong> net worth is around <strong>$250,000,</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Tony Romo</strong></a><strong>'s</strong> net worth is about <strong>$127 Million</strong> as of 2020. Without a doubt, Heather and her family are living a lavish lifestyle with all of these earnings of her husband.</p><h2>Houses And Cars Of Heather's Partner, Derek</h2><p>With all of his Neel's spouse earnings, he has bought some of the lavish houses and cars present in our world. Reportedly, Derek bought a house in Las Vegas, right next to <i>Raiders </i>coach, <strong>Jon Gruden</strong>. He said,</p><p>"He purchased this home, and it's not complete yet, they're still finishing it, but his next-door neighbor is one Jon Gruden. Yup, it happened."</p><p>The average worth of Las Vegas houses is around <strong>$1.5 Million</strong>. So, he must have earned around <strong>$3 million</strong> houses. Moreover, he is a car-lover and owns a couple of branded cars. Some of the cars that he owns are:</p><li><strong>Porsche - $500,000</strong></li><li><strong>Audi - $200,000</strong></li><li><strong>Mercedes - $100,000</strong></li><li><strong>Audi R8 - $160,000</strong></li><p>As of now, he is the co-owner of a training facility, <i>Carr Elite</i>, which is one of his strong income sources in the coming days. Without a doubt, his fortune will rise in the coming days as he is still active in his NFL career.</p><p><i><strong>Stay Tuned With Us: </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong> To Know More About Celebrity Wife</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqGcmqyYmr9uusSeow%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheather-neel.html&text=Heather%20Neel%20shares%20Three%20Children%20with%20her%20Husband%20NFL%20Player%20Derek%20Carr%21%20Know%20her%20Personal%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheather-neel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheather-neel.html&title=Heather%20Neel%20shares%20Three%20Children%20with%20her%20Husband%20NFL%20Player%20Derek%20Carr%21%20Know%20her%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheather-neel.html&title=Heather%20Neel%20shares%20Three%20Children%20with%20her%20Husband%20NFL%20Player%20Derek%20Carr%21%20Know%20her%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheather-neel.html&title=Heather%20Neel%20shares%20Three%20Children%20with%20her%20Husband%20NFL%20Player%20Derek%20Carr%21%20Know%20her%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheather-neel.html&description=Heather%20Neel%20shares%20Three%20Children%20with%20her%20Husband%20NFL%20Player%20Derek%20Carr%21%20Know%20her%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./january-jones-wears-jumpsuit-with-huge-keyhole-cutout-pics-w447041.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="January Jones Wears Jumpsuit With Huge Keyhole Cutout: Pics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hayes-hargrove.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hayes Hargrove - Net Worth, Bio, Career, Married, Age, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
