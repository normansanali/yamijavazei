People have expressed an interest in learning more about Paul since his death.</strong></p><p>On January 18, 2023, Lafarge died, and his wife made the news public. He was well-known as a writer, essayist, and professor. Before his death, he got five Nobel Prizes, and everyone garnered a great reaction and ovation from the crowd. Many well-known persons conveyed their sympathies to his family and paid tribute to him. Dr. Genevieve Guenther described him as her oldest buddy in a photo she uploaded of him.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Paul_Lafarges_Wife_Sarah_Stern>Who Is Paul Lafarge’s Wife, Sarah Stern?</span></h2><p>Paul Lafarge had been married to Sarah Stern for about ten years, and the two had been dating for a long time before being married. They have not made their wedding date public, and they have kept their romantic relationship private. Lafarge’s wife, on the other hand, was always there to encourage him.</p><p>Stern is a co-artistic director at the Vineyard Theatre and has kept her personal life private. However, after her husband died, she confirmed the news. Stern said that he died of cancer at the age of 52, that the couple had been married for decades, and that she had been abandoned.</p><p>Lafarge and Stern have had a beautiful relationship and have inspired many people since their marriage. Stern was always there for her, and she was always there for him till Lafarge died. When Stern confirmed the news in public, people began to express their condolences and remarks to him and his family.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Lafarge_Family_Information>Paul Lafarge Family Information</span></h2><p>Dr. Lucy Bergson LaFarge and Father Thomas raised Paul Lafarge in a middle-class family. He began learning from his father, who was a writer and English instructor, when he was the same age as his father. Lucy is a psychoanalyst when it comes to his father. Lafarge’s parents divorced when he was a teenager, but he spent time with both of them and had a close relationship with both.</p><p>Lafarge had a special bond with his literary stepmother. He spent the majority of his adolescence in Paris, where he worked on numerous publications and other projects. He worked in a variety of industries before becoming well-known as a novelist. He taught English at Wesleyan University before moving on to Columbia to teach writing.</p><p>Lafarge has only given a few details about his parents and another family member in public; he is his parents’ only child, although he has step-siblings on his father’s side. Lafarge was a private person who kept his information to himself. He was focused on his work and had a happy life with his wife and children.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Lafarge_Net_Worth_Before_Death>Paul Lafarge Net Worth Before Death</span></h2><p>People are always curious in profits and net worth, and Paul Lafarge’s net worth has been a hot topic of discussion since his death. Many websites have claimed varying earnings and net worths, but his net worth before death is estimated to be between $1 million and $5 million, according to the source.</p><p>Until his death, he was a lecturer at Bennington College. Among his five novels are Artist of the Missing (1999), Haussmann, or the Distinction (2001), The Facts of Winter (2005), Luminous Airplanes (2011), and The Night Ocean (2017).
