During a recent episode of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Red Table Talk,”</a> the country star, 38, revealed the NFL player cheated on her <a href=#>with “more” than 13 women.</a></p><p>Although Kramer’s journey to find love has had some ups and downs, the “I Got a Boy” songstress has yet to give up on finding a fairytale romance.</p><p>Scroll through for a look at all of Kramer’s past and present leading men:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Gambino</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Kramer has opened up about her abusive relationship with Michael Gambino. <span class=credit>California Department of Correct</span></figure><p>The singer first married Michael Gambino in 2004 in Las Vegas — but things quickly took a turn for the worse.</p><p>Kramer left Gambino less than a year after they tied the knot when he was <a href=#>convicted of attempted murder</a>&nbsp;after he strangled the actress into unconsciousness.</p><p>Since then, she has detailed<a href=#> the abuse she suffered </a>during the brief marriage to Gambino, saying she often feared for her life.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">emotional Instagram post</a> in October 2022, Kramer claimed she would be choked and hit “because I was bad,” which then lead her to believe that she “deserved abuse.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ace Amerson</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The country star reportedly dated Ace Amerson after the end of her first marriage. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Following her split from Gambino, Kramer was rumored to be dating reality TV star Ace Amerson.</p><p>Although the pair never confirmed their romantic relationship, they’ve remained friends throughout the years with Amerson occasionally making appearances on Kramer’s social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Johnathon Schaech</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Kramer and second husband Johnathon Schaech met on a movie set. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>The actress met her second husband, Johnathon Schaech, on the set of their movie “Prom Night” in 2008.</p><p>The former couple dated on and off for three years before tying the knot in 2010 — only for Kramer to file for divorce 12 days later.</p><p>Despite the quick end of their marriage, the starlet<a href=#> told Page Six</a> that she harbored no ill will towards Schaech following their whirlwind marriage.</p><p>“I’m not one to go around and say bad things, I don’t wish anything ill against [Johnathon] and that’s how you gotta do it. If I start saying things, it doesn’t reflect well on me either,” she told us at the time.</p><p>Their divorce was finalized in June 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brantley Gilbert</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The actress was briefly engaged to Brantley Gilbert. <span class=credit>Getty Images for ACM</span></figure><p>Kramer and fellow country star Brantley Gilbert started dating in 2012 after meeting at the CMT Music Awards. The pair fell head over heels for one another and Gilbert got down on one knee after less than one year of dating.</p><p>However, their engagement was short-lived and the twosome decided to go their separate ways a couple of months later.</p><p>Nearly seven years after their split, Kramer revealed she simply wasn’t ready for such a serious commitment at the time.</p><p>“I wasn’t the best version of myself in that relationship. I just wasn’t. I always have a little bit of regret that I didn’t handle things better,” she admitted on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Whine Down With Jana Kramer” podcast.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Scott Eastwood</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The “One Tree Hill” star met Scott Eastwood through mutual friends. <span class=credit>Getty Images for IMDb</span></figure><p>A few months after ending her engagement, the “Why Ya Wanna” songstress was rumored to be dating Scott Eastwood after meeting through mutual friends.</p><p>However, the fling fizzled out quickly and the pair went their separate ways.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mike Caussin</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Kramer was married to Mike Caussin for six years. <span class=credit>Getty Images for iHeartMedia</span></figure><p>Kramer’s longest — <a href=#>and messiest</a> — relationship was with former NFL player Mike Caussin.</p><p>The two met in 2014 and the actress was instantly hooked.</p><p>“When he walked on my tour bus, I was like, ‘That’s the man I’m going to marry,’” she said in a 2015 interview.</p><p>However, the bliss was short-lived as Kramer found out the athlete was cheating on her just months into their relationship. The two got back together shortly after and wed in 2015.</p><p>A few years — and two kids — later, the pair’s relationship hit a rough patch again when the footballer was caught cheating for a second time and started getting <a href=#>treatment for his sex addiction.</a></p><p>“For me, I realized a lot of things throughout my life that sex and sexual acting out was my addictive behavior, and that’s where I went to hide my feelings, to run away from reality and that was my drug,” Caussin<a href=#>&nbsp;said in a 2019 interview</a>&nbsp;with his then-wife.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The exes share two kids: daughter Jolie, 6, and son Jace, 3. <span class=credit>kramergirl/Instagram</span></figure><p>Yet after six years of marriage, Kramer decided it was best for the pair to end their marriage and <a href=#>she filed for divorce</a> in April 2021.</p><p>“‘It’s time,” she wrote on Instagram. “As I try to make sense of a reality I never wanted to believe could be possible again, those words have now become a reality. I’ve fought, y’all. I’ve loved hard. I’ve forgiven. I’ve put the work in. I’ve given everything I have, and now I have nothing else to give.”</p><p>Although Kramer has moved on since the split, she wishes things had been different for the sake of the pair’s<a href=#> daughter Jolie and son Jace.&nbsp;</a></p><p>“I know we’re both in better situations, but I think about this year, my kids won’t wake up at my house [on] Christmas Day. That one’s gonna hurt,” the singer <a href=#>told Jada Pinkett Smith.</a></p><p>“That’s when I get like — ‘That’s not fair.’ He took away my dream of what I wanted for my family.

We are dancing the line, and I am happy.”</p><p>After a couple of months of teetering in and out of the friend zone, the twosome decided to keep their relationship platonic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jay Cutler</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The “I Got a Boy” singer and Jay Cutler went on dates but were never exclusive. <span class=credit>Jason Bihler</span></figure><p>Kramer was later <a href=#>linked to former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler</a> following his own <a href=#>split from Kristen Cavallari</a> in September 2021.
