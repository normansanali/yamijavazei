REALigion, which was a success, peaking at number 58 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.</p><p>On August 14, 2012, his debut studio album “Based on a T.R.U.

Several producers appear on the album, including Mike Will Made-It, Honorable C.N.O.T.E., London on da Track, TM88, Metro Boomin, Zaytoven, and others. The same year, he launched C.E.O. Millionaires, or Create Every Opportunity Millionaires, a line of hoodies.</p><p>The following year, Def Jam Recordings released his fourth studio album, “Pretty Girls Like Trap Music.” Epps alluded to the album displaying “growth” and “maturation.”</p><p>On November 15, 2017, the first episode of the television series “Most Expensive” aired on Viceland. The series follows 2 Chainz as he visits various locations offering the “most expensive” goods and services. The show has been renewed for a third season of 20 episodes.”Rap Or Go To The League,” Epps’ fifth studio album, was released on March 1, 2019.</p><h2>2 Chainz Net Worth 2023</h2><p><strong>2 Chainz estimated net worth is $9 Million as of November 2023.</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Net Worth in 2023</strong></td><td>$9 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth in 2021</strong></td><td>$5-9 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth in 2020</strong></td><td>$5-7 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Source of income</strong></td><td>Rapper, Songwriter, Basketball player, Media Personality</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Annual Salary</strong></td><td>Under Preview</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>2 Chainz is a hip-hop recording artist from the United States with a net worth of $9 million</strong>. 2 Chainz, formerly known as Tity Boi, has emerged as one of the most well-known rappers of the modern era, particularly among other southern musicians.

They have three children together, the eldest of which was born in 2008.</p><h2>2 Chainz Legal Issues</h2><p>2 Chainz has been arrested and charged with drug possession on multiple occasions. One of the most notable incidents involved the arrest of 2 Chainz’s tour bus after a police officer suspected marijuana was being used inside. Because the tour bus driver refused to allow the officer to search the bus, it was towed to a nearby police station. A search warrant was eventually obtained, and police officers discovered several firearms on board.</p><h2>Outside Of Rapping</h2><p>Chainz established a clothing line that sells hoodies and sweaters. He also received brand endorsement deals from Adidas and Beats By Dre, to name a few. 2 Chainz is also a minority owner of the College Park Skyhawks.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhpZpuYnq6vxoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2-chianz-net-worth.html&text=2%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%3f%202%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Income%202023&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2-chianz-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2-chianz-net-worth.html&title=2%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%3f%202%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Income%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2-chianz-net-worth.html&title=2%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%3f%202%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Income%202023" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2-chianz-net-worth.html&title=2%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%3f%202%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Income%202023" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2-chianz-net-worth.html&description=2%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%3f%202%20Chainz%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Income%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./are-mormons-allowed-to-drink.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Mormons allowed to drink?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nelly-furtado.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Nelly Furtado                                          Maneater lyrics   ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
