The House of Juicy Couture’s win was a foregone conclusion after about four episodes, and its sheer and utter dominance (it won Superior House five times. Five!) could have led to a boring competition.<strong> </strong>The reason it didn’t? Because Legendary has the best judging panel on TV.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4d4lu6y00143f6uuvxs2c5e@published data-word-count=107>The judges have always been Legendary’s not-so-secret weapon, and this season they became the real stars of the show. Celebrity stylist Law Roach, with his love of fashion and drama; ballroom legend Leiomy, with her love of performances that complete the damn challenge; and actress Jameela Jamil, who is a producer of the show and is thus still there, were joined by actress, singer, host, and workaholic Keke Palmer, who was brought in to replace rapper Megan Thee Stallion as the fourth judge. While Megan was certainly missed, Palmer fit right in on a judging panel that fought, celebrated, scored, and kept the show entertaining as hell.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4ecmj3a000f3b72umfb8fim@published data-word-count=150>So we thought it only appropriate to return the favor and spend a bit of time judging the judges, scoring each on the four elements of judging:<strong> </strong>personality, judgment, looks, and willingness to fight, all of which are equally important in having not only a fair judging panel but an entertaining one. Five extra challenge points are awarded for best use of the gag flag, a fun but ultimately unnecessary addition this season, which allows a judge to save a house from having to go into the redemption battle. (Yes, it’s because <a href=#>the House of Tisci</a> got screwed over<strong> </strong>last season. Yes, we miss them too.) One note before we start: We’re not including the guest judges on the roster because they’re too diverse in quality to quantify generally. Just know that the best were Leslie Jones, Dominique Jackson and Kelly Rowland, and the worst was the twink who sang.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl4d7ldsr000i3b72ulht2jwm@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Jameela Jamil</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4d4m7ai001i3f6uiei6p8wd@published data-word-count=45><strong>Seasons served: </strong>3<br><strong>Category Is:</strong><br>• Personality: 7/10 — It’s fine.<br>• Judgment: 8/10 — It’s getting better.<br>• Looks: 7/10 — Also getting better, but she still needs to switch up the hair more.<br>• Willingness to fight: 5/10 — She has yet to competently read Law Roach.<br><strong>Score: 27</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4d4n4g9002u3f6ugwal0uva@published data-word-count=175>Look, Jamil is getting better. Our least qualified and <a href=#>most controversial</a> judge seemed to spend most of her time on previous seasons apologizing just for being there. This season, she took baby steps to finding a voice. Of all the judges, she most<strong> </strong>consistently pointed out that the House of Makaveli, the battlecats with nine lives, weren’t up to par. Ultimately, though, Jamil is at her best when she’s the Charlie Brown to Legendary’s Lucy: constantly trying to have a great moment and getting the football pulled away at the last minute. This season, that happened when she pulled her gag flag for the House of Yohji Yamamoto in episode five, thus saving it from elimination despite its dismal score, and instead of getting an emotional moment with the house, Mother Aoki Lee Yamamoto used the moment to shade Leiomy, whose opinion she actually cared about. The scene ended with Mother Yamamoto hugging Leiomy, not Jamil. “I don’t think anyone’s had a more upsetting or disappointing gag flag moment than me,” said Jamil. Well, yeah.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl4ecoa0o000m3b729n99ghcm@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Law Roach</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4d4nt5700313f6u5w1q3gab@published data-word-count=45><strong>Seasons served: </strong>3<br><strong>Category Is:</strong><br>• Personality: 10/10 — I like drama, what can I say?<br>• Judgment: 9/10 — I like drama, what can I say?<br>• Looks: 9/10— The green bodysuit didn’t work for me (for me!).<br>• Willingness to fight: 10/10 — This is his category.<br><strong>Score: 38</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4d4oait00383f6uw6dervlp@published data-word-count=131>On a lot of levels, Law Roach is Legendary. He’s the judge <a href=#>who goes viral</a> every season for being rude to a house. He’s the judge who styles himself and Jamil. He’s the judge with the biggest catchphrase (“You did what needed to be done!”). He’s clearly having a blast on that panel, whether he’s noting the House of Revlon’s Schiaparelli references or asking Mara Makaveli if they want to meet him outside. Excitement over Law’s contributions to the panel will vary, but if you come to the show for drama, Law’s gonna give you drama. Small points are deducted for his continued support of the House of Makaveli because at some point you just have to mercy kill what is clearly the weakest house in every category but the battles.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ms. Roach is hella wrong for this 😭✋ <a href=#>#LegendaryMax</a> <a href=#>#LegendaryHBOmax</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IzojkIEbTM</a></p>— habyer (@xavybriggs) <a href=#>May 26, 2022</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl4ect8gg000r3b72wodgtrww@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Keke Palmer</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4d4phh6003f3f6uz0mbidv9@published data-word-count=61><strong>Seasons served: </strong>1<br><strong>Category Is:</strong><br>• Personality: 10/10 — Took her role seriously but still had fun.

She started the season on a high note with her downright vicious read of the House of Lyght, saying, “When it came down to the elements of vogue, it gave very ‘I just learned this choreography today, and I don’t know what voguing is.’” And ultimately, there is only one judge to whom<strong> </strong>Brooklyn Juicy Couture, the best contestant of the season, could reasonably dedicate her <a href=#>Slay-ground Play-ground Ball performance</a>, and it’s Leiomy. There is only one judge whose innovations form the basis of an entire Legendary challenge, and it’s Leiomy. There is only one judge who could refuse to evaluate a battle and then proceed to walk off the show because it was so bad, and it’s Leiomy. She gets an additional five points for using the gag flag on the House of Juicy Couture, which was never in danger in the first place. Makes sense, <a href=#>since she hated it anyway</a>. More reality-TV judges should just do whatever they want! Tens across the board, a challenge win, and a hearty <a href=#>finger clap</a> are in order.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Judging the Judges of Legendary Season 3</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnytscaepZ2Zoq56tLHArKanZWNit7awxp6qZquTpL%2Bmr8Crm2egpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flegendary-season-3-judges-scorecard-html.html&text=Judging%20the%20Judges%20of%20Legendary%20Season%203&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flegendary-season-3-judges-scorecard-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flegendary-season-3-judges-scorecard-html.html&title=Judging%20the%20Judges%20of%20Legendary%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flegendary-season-3-judges-scorecard-html.html&title=Judging%20the%20Judges%20of%20Legendary%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flegendary-season-3-judges-scorecard-html.html&title=Judging%20the%20Judges%20of%20Legendary%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flegendary-season-3-judges-scorecard-html.html&description=Judging%20the%20Judges%20of%20Legendary%20Season%203" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./katy-perry-orlando-bloom-garden-swimming-pool.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Katy Perry shows off her beautiful garden and swimming pool at home with Orlando Bloom">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jane-wyatt-net-worth-154090.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jane Wyatt Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
