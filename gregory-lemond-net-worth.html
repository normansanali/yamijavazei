Over time he invested in multiple real estate.</p><p>The cyclist has a mansion in Minnesota designed by architect Ken Durr. It was a Georgian-style mansion built-in 1988.</p><p>Likewise, this luxurious mansion featured six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and three half-baths. The real estate covered an area of over 11,550 square feet of space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gregory-LeMond-2.jpg><p>Yet, he relocated his family to the Minnesota home and stayed to compete in Europe.</p><p>In 2008, Greg’s controversy with Lance Armstrong produced backlash for him. Hence, they left their mansion in Belgium to Minnesota to heal.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>In 2002, LeMond invested in the exclusive Yellowstone Club. He joined with his five close family and friends for this investment as partners.</p><p>Each of the five partners paid $750,000 to Blixseth for a 1% stake. Greg also owned a home at the resort and bought several building lots.</p><p>However, things turned ugly for Greg in this investment too. In 2006, Greg and partners sued Blixseth for $39 million and other terms.</p><p>Greg and his family relocated from Minnesota to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 2017. Thus, they got closer to LeMond Composites’ $125 million manufacturing plant.</p><p>Further, Greg has listed his Minnesota mansion for sale at a huge price of $5 million.</p><h3>Car</h3><p>After retiring from professional cycling in 1994, Greg had a new hobby. He loves driving the four wheels at high speeds.</p><p>As a result, he got the USAC-SCCA Formula Ford 2000 Pro Series for Miller Brothers Racing in 1997. Further, he had traded his bikes for the sports car.</p><p>Likewise, the Ford was numbered 83 and was yellow like his jersey in the past.</p><p>In 2017, Greg was involved in a car crash in the suburbs of Minnesota. But, he didn’t sustain serious injuries.</p><h2>Gregory LeMond | Lifestyle and Vacations</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Gregory Lemond prefers a minimal lifestyle. He loves to live sparely without much attention.</p><p>This reason was why he moved from Europe to Minnesota right after his retirement. He felt the attention he got in Belgium was too much for him.</p><p>Similarly, health is the biggest priority for an athlete like him. He loves working out consistently and inspires others to do the same.</p><p>Likewise, Greg believes in organic growth over strength gained by pills and drugs.</p><p>In his book “The Science of Fitness,” he revealed no pill could achieve the results of exercising daily.</p><p>Per his interview with “The Roble,” he admitted consuming almost 6000-1000 calories a day. However, after his retirement, he has based his diet on his book.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>Despite his retirement from cycling, Greg is still active in major cycling events. He visits them as an interviewer or spectator.</p><p>Greg was recently seen climbing the Col D’Izoard. It is a famous pass in the mountain alps of France. Col D’Izoard has been home to key moments in the Tour de France.</p><p>Despite his retirement from cycling, Greg is active in major cycling events. He visits them as an interviewer or to enjoy the event. Greg uses these opportunities to relax and getaway.</p><p>Recently, Greg posted on Instagram about his visit to Col du Galibier. He spent a warm afternoon hiking the terrain.</p><h2>Gregory LeMond | Charity</h2><p>Many might have no idea, but Greg was sexually exploited for several years by his uncle. Then, he saw him jailed for sexually assaulting another child.</p><p>Thus, LeMond had decided to help the male victims of child sex abuse. Hence, Greg is a founding board member “of 1in6.org,” a non-profit organization.</p><p>It is dedicated to helping male victims who have had abusive experiences. Greg is a front runner in helping these victims live healthier and happier lives.</p><p>Accordingly, when Greg settled his lawsuits, they donated $200,000 to the foundation.</p><p>Similarly, Greg represented in the Get Back Challenge Cycle in June 2013. He helped raise money for the Limerick Sports Partnership in this event.</p><p>Likewise, in 2016, Greg returned to La Crosse for a charity event. “Ride with Greg” was a polio fundraiser featuring riding with Greg LeMond for 30$.</p><h3>Foundation and Merch&nbsp;</h3><p>In 2018, Greg agreed to serve on the Velodrome Development Foundation. He joined the Board of Directors as Honorary Chairman. It was a non-profit organization established by the community and athletes.</p><p>In 2020, the merchandise was announced to celebrate Greg’s 1989 Tour de France triumph.</p><p>US National Team would use the money earned from selling the memoir T-shirt to support the US National team.

This documentary was part of the 30 for 30 movie series hosted by ESPN.</p><p>LeMond joined Eurosport as a cycling analyst in 2014. Then, he provided commentary at Paris–Roubaix, the Giro d’Italia, and the Tour de France.</p><p>Also, he hosted his monthly show on Cycling, which remained with the network until 2017.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>During his career, Greg was at the top of the game with multiple Tour De France wins. He seemed to be a strong endorser, which he continued into his post-career as an investor.</p><p>During his time at ADR, Greg was sponsored by a beer company named Coors Light for American races. Also, many cycle companies were waiting for his signature.</p><p>Hence, Greg has had no trouble securing sponsorship deals. Yet something was different about the way he approached the deals.</p><p>He worked with the companies directly rather than a monetary endorsement. Hence, there aren’t many sponsorships. Instead, he would interact and invest in the advanced technology himself.</p><h3>Investments</h3><h4>Carbon Fibers Cycle</h4><p>Greg won a majority of his Tour De France wins on a Carbon fiber cycle. Hence, in 1990 he founded LeMond bicycles.</p><p>The idea was to create devices for him to ride. Also, he wanted to sell these custom bikes to the general public.</p><p>But, over time, he realized he needs to venture with expert companies to gain an advantage.</p><p>Thus, he signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Carbonframes, Inc. The deal provided access to their advanced technologies.</p><p>At first, the whole idea of the Carbonframes-built “Greg LeMond” bicycle was successful.</p><p>He shortly led the 1991 Tour de France. Yet, the company ultimately went bankrupt because of poor management by his father.</p><p>Consequently, Carbonframes and his company parted ways. It had only been two years since the start of their partnership.</p><p>LeMond struck a licensing deal with Trek Bicycle Corporation in 1995. The agreement would allow the company to produce and sell bicycles built by LeMond.</p><p>Per NY Daily News, this production process brought Trek over $100 million in sales. As a result, it was renewed several times over 13 years.</p><h4>Controversies in Investment</h4><p>In July 2001, LeMond fell out with Trek. He publicly criticized the relationship between Michele Ferrari and Lance Armstrong. But Lance was Trek’s star athlete.</p><p>As a result, Trek felt Greg’s public remarks damaged the brand. Then, they pressured Greg to apologize.</p><p>Yet, over time the relationship went from bad to worse. Consequently, Trek was sued in March 2008 by LeMond Cycling Inc.</p><p>Greg believed Trek hadn’t advertised and distribute the LeMond brand after his remark.</p><p>In April 2008, Trek decided to drop their deal with LeMond Bikes. After few years of lawsuits, Greg acquired the LeMond bikes name.</p><p>And Trek donated $200,000 to his foundation per settlement.</p><h3>New Partnership</h3><p>In September 2013, LeMond revealed that he was partnering with French company Time. He wanted to return to the bicycle production and sales market as soon as possible.</p><p>Hence, the new line started with a collection of commemorative-themed bicycles.</p><p>The products were a huge success in the early markets. Consequently, Time Sport USA was bought by Greg.</p><h4>Fitness and Revolution</h4><p>Everyone knew Greg to be an athlete with the toughest endurance levels. Therefore, LeMond Fitness Inc. was founded in 2002 by Greg and Bernie Boglioli to help other athletes.</p><p>The idea for this investment was to help individuals meet their fitness goals. Also, they allowed athletes to practice effectively.</p><p>Hoist Fitness bought a stake in this company in 2012. Then, they announced plans to relocate its headquarters to San Diego, California.</p><p>Over time Greg saw potential in the stakes he sold. So, he bought the LeMond Revolution from Hoist in late 2012.</p><p>Accordingly, Greg relaunched it in Minneapolis with a new management team. Later, he invested in LeMond LLC to launch a line of products.</p><p>In late 2012, LeMond purchased the LeMond Revolution from Hoist, relaunching with a new management team in Minneapolis.</p><h4>Restaurant&nbsp;</h4><p>Greg was making constant investments at the peak of his career. In 1990, Greg invested in “Scott Kee’s Tour de France,” located on France Avenue.</p><p>It was a family-based restaurant which had been his dream for a long time.&nbsp; Further, Greg also invested in several bagel-based bakery cafes.</p><h4>New Technologies</h4><p>Greg created LeMond Composites in 2016. He aimed to produce high-volume, low-cost carbon fiber composites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Greg-LeMond-3-1024x704.jpg><p>This business venture was an immense success. Consequently, Greg received funding from the Australian Government of AU of $2.5 million.</p><p>They wanted to construct a carbon fiber manufacturing plant in Australia.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>Amongst others, “The Science of Fitness” is one such book authored by Greg LeMond and Dr. Mark Hom.</p><p>The book is dedicated to portraying the relationship between exercise, nutrition, and physiology. So, it is considered a must-read for both experienced and amateur athletes.</p><p>Similarly, “The Comeback: Greg LeMond” is another book written about him. Daniel de Vise authored this book. Accordingly, he tries to give us a vivid account of Greg’s life in a nutshell.</p><p>It was originally published in 1998. This book was his reaction to challenges and allegations Greg faced during his career.</p><p>Additionally, Greg wrote “Greg LEM Pckt Noncomb” himself.
