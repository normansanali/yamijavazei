But after being tended to by the first responders, she was revived at the stadium as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared by her friend, Thiago Fernandes</a>. Unfortunately, she went into a second cardiac arrest on the way to the Salagdo Filho Hospital and passed away during emergency care after arrival.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Ana had been excited to attend Taylor’s concert for a long time, as shared by Thiago in his tribute post to his friend on Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by thiago fernandes (@thxaguito)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>He also wants Ana’s picture to appear on the screens during Taylor Swift’s concert.
