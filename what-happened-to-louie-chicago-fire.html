It's been years since Casey has seen the two boys, and the request to help them has brought up some things from his past, specifically his former foster child, Louie.</p><p>Louie hasn't been a part of the Chicago Fire cast since Season 5 â€” but what happened to him on the show? And what happened to the actor who played him?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Louie on 'Chicago Fire'? Casey has tried to foster children before.</h2><p>Louie's time on the show dates back to when Casey was with Gabby Dawson (Monica Raymund). The pair saved Louie from a fire and Gabby instantly bonded with him. When she learned that his regular foster mother could no longer take him in, Gabby and Casey applied to foster him.</p><p>At the time, the pair weren't married, but as their connection to Louie deepened, so did their relationship. Casey and Gabby decided to marry when they wanted to file for custody of Louie â€” but it, unfortunately, wasn't that easy.</p><p>Around that same time, Louie's biological father came back into the picture and wanted custody of his son.</p><p>Gabby and Casey had already bonded with Louie at that point, and the pair wanted to fight for custody of their foster child. In the end, though, the pair decided that they couldn't bear to part him from his biological family and ultimately agreed to give up custody to Louie's father.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>OK casey mentioned Louie, his son and now iâ€™m hurt ðŸ™ƒ <a href=#>#ChicagoFire</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KRHEtZUAA3</a></p>â€” Maryann ðŸ§¡ðŸ’™ (@metsmars) <a href=#>March 19, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>This did massive damage to their marriage, and despite the fact they had been dating for years, it was what tore them apart in the end.</p><p>The last time that Casey was a foster parent, he not only lost a child with whom he had bonded very closely, but he also lost his partner. Now that he is considering taking in Griffin and Ben Darden, Casey is forced to revisit these feelings in Season 10.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who played Louie on 'Chicago Fire'?</h2><p>Baby Louie was played by Austin Cohen when he was only 3. The child actor was only beginning his career at the time and continued his recurring role for 10 episodes.</p><p>After that, according to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> page, Austin was an intern on a short film called Margot, though at this time he has no other acting credits.</p><p>Austin has a twin brother, Aiden, who is also an actor. According to his IMDb page, the two go by "The Cohen Twins" for their roles.</p><p>The pair also have a joint <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> account with more than 3,000 followers, where their parents share updates on their lives. They are now in the third grade.</p><p>You can watch Chicago Fire on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSlp6Wesm6vx6Kamp%2BfYrOqvsQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-louie-chicago-fire.html&text=%27Chicago%20Fire%27%20Fans%20Are%20Reminded%20of%20Casey%27s%20Ex-Foster%20Child%20Louie%20in%20Season%2010&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-louie-chicago-fire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-louie-chicago-fire.html&title=%27Chicago%20Fire%27%20Fans%20Are%20Reminded%20of%20Casey%27s%20Ex-Foster%20Child%20Louie%20in%20Season%2010" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-louie-chicago-fire.html&title=%27Chicago%20Fire%27%20Fans%20Are%20Reminded%20of%20Casey%27s%20Ex-Foster%20Child%20Louie%20in%20Season%2010" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-louie-chicago-fire.html&title=%27Chicago%20Fire%27%20Fans%20Are%20Reminded%20of%20Casey%27s%20Ex-Foster%20Child%20Louie%20in%20Season%2010" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-louie-chicago-fire.html&description=%27Chicago%20Fire%27%20Fans%20Are%20Reminded%20of%20Casey%27s%20Ex-Foster%20Child%20Louie%20in%20Season%2010" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./friendsgiving-menu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Friends Giving Menu">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./will-meyers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Meyers">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
