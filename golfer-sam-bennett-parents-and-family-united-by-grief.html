Sam grew up with his two brothers Marcus and Jake Bennett.</p><p>His intrigue with golf was sparked by his father and siblings, who were all involved in sports. His father, Mark, taught Sam and his two brothers to play golf on a public nine-hole course in their hometown.</p><p>The 23-year-old has been playing the game since he was young. He is the current reigning U.S. Amateur champion and a former World No. 1. Bennett is currently ranked sixth globally.</p><p>Furthermore, Bennett will be competing at Augusta National Golf Course as part of the 2023 Masters’ Augusta amateurs.

By Sam’s senior year of high school, Mark had already lost the ability to recognize him and his older brothers.</p><p>It’s been challenging for Bennett to remember his father’s healthy days before he lost the ability to communicate. Bennett finds solace in videos that help him recall his father’s past. He holds on dearly to the last five words of advice his father gave him “Don’t wait to do something.”&nbsp;</p><p>These words are tattooed on Bennett’s left forearm in his father’s handwriting, and he looks down at them every day.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-bennet-mother></span>Sam Bennet Mother<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sam Bennet mom Stacy Bennett is a language arts teacher at Madisonville Junior High School.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, her Facebook bio also highlights that she teaches 7th and 8th-grade ELA/Rdg, which refers to English Language Arts/Reading.</p><p>Furthermore, Stacy is an outdoor enthusiast who enjoys biking, hiking, and other outdoor activities.
