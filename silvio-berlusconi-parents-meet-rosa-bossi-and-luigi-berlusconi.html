He is a figure who has left an indelible mark on Italian politics and society. With his charismatic personality, business acumen, and controversial scandals, his life story is nothing short of intriguing. Read this article to find out more about his parents.</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Silvio Berlusconi was born on September 29, 1936, in Milan, Italy. He grew up in a middle-class family. His father worked as a bank employee, and his mother was a housewife. Berlusconi displayed an early entrepreneurial spirit, starting his first venture at the age of 16 by selling vacuum cleaners. He later enrolled in law school at the University of Milan but soon found his true calling in business.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the 1960s, he ventured into the construction industry and began his ascent to wealth and success. He established a small construction company that eventually grew into a vast empire, Fininvest. Through shrewd business strategies and acquisitions, Berlusconi expanded Fininvest’s interests into a diverse range of sectors, including real estate, publishing, finance, and most notably, media.</p><p>His foray into media ownership began with the acquisition of a local television station, Telemilano, in the 1970s. This marked the beginning of his media empire, Mediaset, which would grow to encompass three national television channels, a publishing division, and a film production company. With Mediaset, Berlusconi became a prominent figure in the Italian media landscape, wielding significant influence over public opinion and political discourse.</p><p>His political career began in the early 1990s, following a period of political turmoil in Italy. In 1994, he founded Forza Italia (Go Italy), a right-wing political party that aimed to counter the dominance of established political forces. Riding on his popularity as a media mogul, Berlusconi emerged as a powerful force in Italian politics and won the general elections in 1994, becoming the Prime Minister of Italy for the first time.</p><p>However, his political career was marred by controversies and legal troubles. His tenure as Prime Minister was marked by frequent clashes with the judiciary, allegations of corruption, and charges of tax fraud. Berlusconi faced multiple trials and legal battles throughout his political career, although some charges were dropped or overturned on appeal.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite his legal troubles, Berlusconi remained a formidable political figure. He served as Prime Minister for a total of three non-consecutive terms: from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006, and from 2008 to 2011. His political ideology, characterized by a mix of conservative values and populist rhetoric, appealed to a significant portion of the Italian electorate.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Berlusconi’s leadership style and personal life also drew attention. He was known for his extravagant lifestyle, characterized by lavish parties, opulent residences, and a penchant for beautiful women. His personal scandals, including alleged involvement with escorts and his publicized divorce from his second wife, added to the fascination surrounding his life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>After leaving office in 2011, Berlusconi faced further legal challenges and political setbacks. In 2013, he was convicted of tax fraud and banned from holding public office. However, he remained influential within his political party, Forza Italia, and continued to be an influential figure in Italian politics.</p><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Silvio Berlusconi Children: Meet Pier Silvio, Luigi, Marina, Barbara, Eleonora</a></p><h2><strong>Silvio Berlusconi Parents</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Silvio Berlusconi was born to his parents Luigi Berlusconi and Rosa Bossi. His father, Luigi Berlusconi, worked as a bank employee, while his mother, Rosa Bossi, was a housewife.</p><p>Luigi Berlusconi’s occupation as a bank employee provided the family with a stable income, but they did not enjoy substantial wealth. Despite their modest means, Silvio Berlusconi’s parents instilled in him the values of hard work, ambition, and determination.</p><p>Rosa Bossi, Berlusconi’s mother, played an essential role in shaping his character and nurturing his aspirations. She encouraged his entrepreneurial spirit from a young age, supporting and motivating him to pursue his ambitions. Her influence, combined with his father’s work ethic, laid the foundation for Berlusconi’s future success.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC%2FyKWtoqddl7KzuNSsmqimmWK9or7Ep6usZZ2asrV50aiqmmWSpMC0tYyapZ1lnKq2qLWMm5yrpKWosLC6yGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsilvio-berlusconi-parents-meet-rosa-bossi-and-luigi-berlusconi.html&text=Silvio%20Berlusconi%20Parents%3a%20Meet%20Rosa%20Bossi%20And%20Luigi%20Berlusconi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsilvio-berlusconi-parents-meet-rosa-bossi-and-luigi-berlusconi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsilvio-berlusconi-parents-meet-rosa-bossi-and-luigi-berlusconi.html&title=Silvio%20Berlusconi%20Parents%3a%20Meet%20Rosa%20Bossi%20And%20Luigi%20Berlusconi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsilvio-berlusconi-parents-meet-rosa-bossi-and-luigi-berlusconi.html&title=Silvio%20Berlusconi%20Parents%3a%20Meet%20Rosa%20Bossi%20And%20Luigi%20Berlusconi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsilvio-berlusconi-parents-meet-rosa-bossi-and-luigi-berlusconi.html&title=Silvio%20Berlusconi%20Parents%3a%20Meet%20Rosa%20Bossi%20And%20Luigi%20Berlusconi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsilvio-berlusconi-parents-meet-rosa-bossi-and-luigi-berlusconi.html&description=Silvio%20Berlusconi%20Parents%3a%20Meet%20Rosa%20Bossi%20And%20Luigi%20Berlusconi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-confirms-speak-now-taylors-version-album-all-we-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift confirms Speak Now (Taylor's Version) album - all we know">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./queen-are-responsible-for-mtvs-first-ever-banned-song-body-language.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Queen Are Responsible For MTV's First Ever Banned Song">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
