He served in those roles before being named assistant coach from 1985 to 1987. In 1988, he moved to Kent State where he remained until 1995, holding various leadership positions.&nbsp;In 1996, he started working for Florida Gators as an assistant head coach and defensive coordinator until 1998.</span></p><p><span>His journey with Oklahoma began in 1999. In his freshman season, he led the team to its first Super Bowl since 1994. By 2000, he had not only led the team to the BCS National Championship, but also maintained a season-high unbeaten record.&nbsp;After spending 18 years with the team, Bob Stoops retired with a very good record.</span></p><p><span>In addition to being the only coach to win the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, and Sugar Bowl in the BCS era, he also achieved 10 Big 12s, becoming the Big 12 coach of the year 6 times.</span></p><p><span>A statue in his honor was erected at the Gaylord Family Stadium.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Why did he withdraw?</span></strong></h2><p><span>After spending 18 seasons with the team, Bob Stoops, the longest-serving coach in college football history, announced his retirement from his position to the shock of many.&nbsp;Before his sudden retirement in 2017, Stoops, who was just 56, had already told his mentor, Steve Spurrier, that he would continue to play until he was 65.</span></p><p><span>With more successive successes than any other coachStoops didn’t wait to reach that age before quitting because of what happened to his father.&nbsp;The fact that his father suffered a heart attack while coaching before he passed away had always been in the back of his mind and so he wanted to keep his health in check.</span></p><p><span>Also, Stoops, whose last game with the Sooners was a Sugar Bowl win over Auburn, stepped out to spend some more time with his family.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family, wife, daughter, son, brother</span></strong></h2><p><span>As stated, Bob Stoops came from a family of football coaches.&nbsp;While his older brother, Ron Jr. works as an assistant coach at Youngstown State University, his younger brother, Mike Stoops, previously worked with Sooners as a defensive coordinator, while Mark Stoops, the youngest, is the coach. of the University of Kentucky team.&nbsp;He is in his sixth season with the team.</span></p><p><span>Bob is married to Carol Stoops, national sales manager for Mary Kay before he retired.&nbsp;The couple are blessed with a daughter, Mackenzie, and twin sons, Isaac and Drake.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGian5d6or7Rnqqtq12dtrR5w5qsoKCkmr9utMisZLChlpp6qbXSZqqopqNitaq%2FjJupqKyYmr9utMisZJ%2BZnZ65unnWobBmnJmZeqmxjLCgraCUp664ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbob-arrests-his-daughter-his-wife-his-sons-his-brother-his-family-why-did-he-withdraw.html&text=Bob%20arrests%20his%20daughter%2c%20his%20wife%2c%20his%20sons%2c%20his%20brother%2c%20his%20family%2c%20why%20did%20he%20withdraw%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbob-arrests-his-daughter-his-wife-his-sons-his-brother-his-family-why-did-he-withdraw.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbob-arrests-his-daughter-his-wife-his-sons-his-brother-his-family-why-did-he-withdraw.html&title=Bob%20arrests%20his%20daughter%2c%20his%20wife%2c%20his%20sons%2c%20his%20brother%2c%20his%20family%2c%20why%20did%20he%20withdraw%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbob-arrests-his-daughter-his-wife-his-sons-his-brother-his-family-why-did-he-withdraw.html&title=Bob%20arrests%20his%20daughter%2c%20his%20wife%2c%20his%20sons%2c%20his%20brother%2c%20his%20family%2c%20why%20did%20he%20withdraw%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbob-arrests-his-daughter-his-wife-his-sons-his-brother-his-family-why-did-he-withdraw.html&title=Bob%20arrests%20his%20daughter%2c%20his%20wife%2c%20his%20sons%2c%20his%20brother%2c%20his%20family%2c%20why%20did%20he%20withdraw%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbob-arrests-his-daughter-his-wife-his-sons-his-brother-his-family-why-did-he-withdraw.html&description=Bob%20arrests%20his%20daughter%2c%20his%20wife%2c%20his%20sons%2c%20his%20brother%2c%20his%20family%2c%20why%20did%20he%20withdraw%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ashton-kutcher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cameron Diaz at the What Happens in Vegas premiere">&larr;
