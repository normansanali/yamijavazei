She grew up alongside her two siblings, Yannis and Amanda. Her family was always there for her and supported her to pursue a professional tennis career.</p><p>She currently resides in Monte Carlo, and according to all available information, she attended Athens College.

At the age of 18, she relocated to Barcelona for proper training.</p><p>She was defeated in her first two WTA Tour matches in 2015. Maria lost in the first round of qualification at the Rio Open to Maria Irigoyen, and she also fell in the last round of qualification at the Bucharest Open to Daria Kasatkina. She was always prepared to confront failures, yet she never gave up.</p><p>She took it all in stride and continued to try. Following the US Open, she broke into the top 200 for the first time, landing at 185. Later that year, she qualified for the Australian Open, where she defeated Wang Yafan.</p><p>In the same year, she qualified but was defeated in the first round by Irina-Camella Begu. She made her first WTA Tour semi-final in 2017 by defeating Caroline Wozniacki, Elena Vesnina, and Alize Cornet at the Wuhan Open. In October 2017, her achievement propels her into the top 50 in the WTA rankings.</p><h2><span id=Ascend_to_Fame>Ascend to Fame</span></h2><p>Maria Sakkari won the Australian Open, the year’s opening Grand Slam competition, and advanced to the Round of 16 for the first time. She just began the season strongly in 2021, reaching the quarterfinals of Abu Dhabi with victories over Anastasia Potapova, Coco Gauff, and Garbine Muguruza. She was one game away from adding another victory to her record, but she was defeated in a long match against Barbora Krejková.</p><p>It lasted more than 3 hours, and she won in the second lag but lost in the end. Following that, she competed in Wimbledon but was unable to advance since she was eliminated in the second round. Maria competed in the US Open as the 17th seed and maintained her aggressiveness on the court. She advanced to the semifinals, where she would face another bright young athlete, Emma Raducanu.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Tom Stenberg</a>, <a href=#>Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy</a>, and <a href=#>Morgane Stapleton</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>tennis player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Helen Kelesi</a></h3>Helen Kelesi estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
