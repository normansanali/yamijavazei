She was also a passionate artist who created vibrant paintings, sculptures, and films that reflected her vision and values. She was a trailblazer who defied conventions and pursued her dreams with courage and creativity. Here are some facts about her life and legacy.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" href=#><i class="ez-toc-glyphicon ez-toc-icon-toggle"></i></a></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_Education></span><strong>Early Life & Education</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Altina Schinasi was born on August 4, 1907, in Manhattan, New York to immigrant parents. Her father, Morris Schinasi, was a Sephardic Jewish Turk who made his fortune in the international fine tobacco business. Her mother, Laurette Schinasi, was a native of Salonica (then in the Ottoman Empire) and a granddaughter of his business partner. Altina was the youngest of three daughters and grew up in a luxurious mansion on the Upper West Side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Altina-Schinasi-biodata.jpg><p>Altina Schinasi was tutored at home until she was 12 years old when she left to board at Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. After graduating from high school, she moved to Paris with her mother and sister to study painting with her cousin René Bensussan. She developed a deep appreciation for the arts and decided to pursue a career as an artist. She returned to New York and enrolled at The Art Students League, where she studied with Samuel Halpert at the Roerich Museum.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_and_Achievements></span><strong>Career and Achievements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Altina Schinasi began her career as a window display designer for Fifth Avenue stores, where she worked with prominent artists such as Salvador Dalí and George Grosz. She also learned from them at an art class run by Grosz at the Art Students League. She was inspired by their innovative and expressive styles and experimented with different media and techniques.</p><p>One day, while walking down the street, she noticed that the existing frames of glasses for women were dull and boring. She decided to create a new design that would be more flattering and fashionable. She was influenced by the Harlequin masks that she saw people wearing in Venice during the Carnevale festival and came up with the idea of cat-eye glasses. She cut paper demos of her design and tried to find a manufacturer who would produce them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Altina-Schinasi-wiki.jpg><p>However, she faced many rejections from the major manufacturers who thought her design was too edgy and risky. She did not give up and approached a local shop owner named Lugene on Madison Avenue who agreed to sell her glasses. Her first customer was writer Clare Boothe Luce who bought a pair of red cat-eye glasses. Soon, her glasses became a sensation and a symbol of glamour in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They were worn by celebrities such as Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, and Elizabeth Taylor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Altina-Schinasi-movie.jpg><p>Altina Schinasi sold her eyewear company in the mid-1940s and moved to Los Angeles with her first husband Morris B. Sanders, an architect whom she married in 1928. They had two sons, Terry Sanders and Denis Sanders, both of whom became film directors. Altina continued to paint and sculpt in Los Angeles and exhibited her work at various galleries and museums. She also ventured into filmmaking and produced several documentaries on social issues such as racism, poverty, war, and human rights.</p><p>One of her notable films was George Grosz’ Interregnum (1960), which was based on the life and work of her former teacher George Grosz who fled Nazi Germany in 1932. The film won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in 1961. Another film that she produced was Operation Bootstrap (1968), which documented the industrialization of Puerto Rico after World War II.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Altina-Schinasi-wikipedia.jpg><p>Altina Schinasi also wrote a memoir titled The Road I Have Travelled (1995), in which she shared her personal and professional experiences as an artist and an activist. She also volunteered as an art therapist for children with disabilities and refugees.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><strong>Parents & Siblings </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Altina Schinasi had a very interesting family background and heritage. She was the youngest of three daughters born to Morris Schinasi and Laurette Schinasi, who were both immigrants from the Ottoman Empire. Her father was a Sephardic Jewish Turk who made his fortune in the international fine tobacco business. He built a luxurious mansion on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Altina grew up.</p><p>Her mother was a native of Salonica, which is now part of Greece. She was the granddaughter of Joseph Ben Rubi, who was Morris Schinasi’s business partner. Altina’s parents were very supportive of her artistic pursuits and encouraged her to study painting in Paris and New York.</p><p>Altina had two sisters, Renee and Yvonne, who were also involved in the arts. Renee was a painter and a sculptor, who married René Bensussan, Altina’s cousin and teacher. Yvonne was a pianist and a composer, who married George Antheil, a famous avant-garde musician. Altina and her sisters were very close and often collaborated on various projects.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life_Husband_Kids></span><strong>Personal Life, Husband & Kids </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Altina Schinasi married four times in her life.
