Another such hit debuting back in September 2022 is the Australian comedy <strong>Heartbreak High</strong>, which immediately received enormous praise from the many who watched it thanks to its eye-catching blend of Sex Education's raunchiness and<strong> Heartstopper</strong>'s comfort.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Intended as a <a href=#><strong>soft reboot of the cult classic 90s series</strong></a> of the same name, Heartbreak High proved to have all the same style and substance as the original while also <strong>updating the viewing experience for a modern audience</strong>. Loved for its quotability and cast of hilarious characters, the renewal of the series for a sophomore outing has left many wondering exactly who might be <a href=#><strong>coming back to school</strong></a>. Well, wonder no more, for here is a guide to who is returning to class in <a href=#><strong>Heartbreak High Season 2</strong></a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/heartbreak-high-2022-netflix.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="‘Heartbreak High’ Season 2: Everything We Know Ahead of the Show’s Return">‘Heartbreak High’ Season 2: Everything We Know Ahead of the Show’s Return</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Netflix's reboot of the Australian teen hit is returning for a second season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ayesha-madon>Ayesha Madon</h2><h3 id=amerie>Amerie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ayesha-madon-heartbreak-high-1.jpg><p>Amerie's superb intelligence and lightning wit are ready to get her in and out of trouble. Coming from a working-class background, she is<strong> always willing to stand her ground and fight for what she believes in</strong>, making her often the center of many a drama.</p><p>Despite their young age, Heartbreak High's cast contains a host of mature performances, perhaps none more so than <strong>Ayesha Madon</strong>'s. Her ability to blend the comedy and drama required in this genre seems to come as second nature, highlighted by her nomination for Best Actress for her portrayal of Amerie at the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts. Madon may also be known for her roles in <strong>The Moth Effect </strong>and <strong>Love Me</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chloe-hayden>Chloe Hayden</h2><h3 id=quinni>Quinni</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/HeartbreakHighS1-Chloe-Hayden-1.jpg><p>Incomparably adorable and often unapologetically honest, Quinni's time at Hartley High has thus far been a struggle for her, with her neurodivergence and the difficulties it comes with <strong>portrayed with subtlety and respect by actress Chloe Hayden</strong>. Despite these struggles, though, the love for life that Quinni has also bounced off the screen and into the hearts of the audience, with the show managing to neatly tackle a sensitive topic with one eye on education and another on sensitivity.</p><p>Taking on the role of Quinni was crucially going to require a lot of nuance and skill, so luckily, the casting team managed to acquire the talents of Chloe Hayden, with her endearing and true-to-life performance receiving plenty of praise. Beyond the walls of Heartbreak High, Hayden has appeared in the likes of <strong>Spooky Files </strong>and <strong>Counter Girls</strong> while also being a best-selling author, motivational speaker, and disability rights activist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thomas-weatherall>Thomas Weatherall</h2><h3 id=malakai>Malakai</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/malakai-heartbreak-high.jpg><p>Every great high-school comedy needs a budding, athletic male lead. However, Malakai is more than just an excellent basketball player, with his recent arrival in season one of Heartbreak High instantly putting him on the back foot. However, Malakai's charming ability to make friends soon changed his fortunes, with Season 2 likely to present newer and more difficult challenges for him.</p><p>Perhaps Heartbreak High's most eye-catching performance, <strong>Thomas Weatherall</strong>'s engaging and touching portrayal of Malakai landed him wins for Best Supporting Actor at both the Logie Awards and the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards, with his addition to the Season 2 ensemble feeling crucial to its success. Known also for his work in the likes of <strong>RFDS </strong>and <strong>All My Friends Are Racist</strong>, Weatherall is attached to two more upcoming projects beyond Heartbreak High's sophomore outing - <strong>Exposure </strong>and <strong>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bryn-chapman-parish>Bryn Chapman-Parish</h2><h3 id=spencer>Spencer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gemma-chua-tran-bryn-chapman-parish-ayesha-madon-heartbreak-high.jpg><p>Best friends with<strong> Brodie Townsend</strong>'s Ant and never far from a bickering row, Spencer, also known as Spider, is the sort of opinionated jock that the high-school rom-com thrives off. Disagreeable and often controversial, Spencer's favorite hobby is attending the biggest party and school and flexing his social muscles.</p><p>Having wanted to be an actor since he was 8 years old, Bryn Chapman Parish made his on-screen debut in an uncredited role in <strong>Unbroken</strong>. The following decade saw appearances in <strong>Mr Inbetween</strong>, <strong>Idiot-Proof</strong>, and, most notably, Heartbreak High. With a cinematography credit also to his name, Chapman-Parish looks like one to watch for the future of Australian acting, with his upcoming appearance in Season 2 looking to build on his solid showing in the first outing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brodie-townsend>Brodie Townsend</h2><h3 id=ant>Ant</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/heartbreak-high-ant-1.jpg><p>Always ready with a shoulder to cry on or a joke to cheer you up, <strong>Ant is the friend everyone needs</strong>, with his unending kindness and respect for those around him regularly translating into him going above and beyond to save the day.</p><p>Actor Brodie Townsend might be the most inexperienced of the Heartbreak High ensemble, but that inexperience certainly doesn't translate on screen. Despite only having one other acting credit to his name in the form of a double episode appearance in the TV miniseries <strong>Significant Others</strong>, Brodie Townsend's performance as Ant in Heartbreak High has already done enough to earn him plenty of fans. Let's hope this is just the beginning of a terrific on-screen career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kartanya-maynard>Kartanya Maynard</h2><h3 id=zoe-clark>Zoe Clark</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deadloch_episode_3_kartanya_maynard_leonie_whyman.jpg><p>A new addition to the Heartbreak High class of 2024, the dogmatic Zoe Clarke's role in the upcoming Season 2 looks set to be pivotal, with her group of Puriteens and their devotion to celibacy putting the entire SLT class at risk.</p><p>Young actress <strong>Kartanya Maynard</strong> joins the Heartbreak High ensemble fresh from her wonderful portrayal of Miranda Hoskins in the black comedy <strong>Deadloch</strong>. Receiving much praise already across her very short career to date, adding Heartbreak High to her resume will certainly increase her reputation. Maynard has also appeared in the likes of <strong>The Messenger </strong>and <strong>Gold Diggers</strong>.</p><p>Heartbreak High Season 2<strong> opens its classroom doors on April 11</strong>, with streaming available via Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/heartbreak-high-tv-show-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Heartbreak High">Heartbreak High</a></h5>TV-MADramaRomance <strong>Release Date</strong> <span>September 14, 2022</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Ayesha Madon , James Majoos , Chloe Hayden , Asher Yasbincek</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Drama</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>2</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ktaat0a2Zq52RoHqptcahZKydkai8r3mRZpqaq6RisKmt0ZqarZ2iqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheartbreak-high-season-2-cast-characters.html&text=%27Heartbreak%20High%27%20Season%202%20Cast%20and%20Character%20Guide&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheartbreak-high-season-2-cast-characters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheartbreak-high-season-2-cast-characters.html&title=%27Heartbreak%20High%27%20Season%202%20Cast%20and%20Character%20Guide" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheartbreak-high-season-2-cast-characters.html&title=%27Heartbreak%20High%27%20Season%202%20Cast%20and%20Character%20Guide" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheartbreak-high-season-2-cast-characters.html&title=%27Heartbreak%20High%27%20Season%202%20Cast%20and%20Character%20Guide" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheartbreak-high-season-2-cast-characters.html&description=%27Heartbreak%20High%27%20Season%202%20Cast%20and%20Character%20Guide" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-does-burger-king-barbie-meal-taste-like.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Burger King Introduces 'Barbie' Combo Meal, but It's Only Available in One Country">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-is-bts-hated-in-the-k-pop-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is BTS hated in the K-Pop world?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
