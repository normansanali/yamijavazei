According to Intel, Horse Ridge will enable commercially viable quantum computers.
The Horse Ridge cryogenic control chip will control multiple quantum bits (qubits) at the same time, an essential capability required to build a large-scale commercial quantum system, according to Intel. The chipmaker has experimented with silicon spin qubit and superconducting qubit systems and believes that the major challenges for commercial-scale quantum computing are interconnects and control electronics, not production of qubits — compute elements that exist in multiple states simultaneously — themselves.</description></item><item><title>Is Celine Dion Dating?

小松菜奈
菅田さんと小松さんといえば、過去に多くの作品で共演し、交際の噂がされていました。
二人のファンは前々から二人が結婚することに期待していましたが、それがしっかり実現されたということで祝福よりも「ホッとした」というような声が多くありました。
素晴らしい作品で共演してる二人ですが、過去の作品について振り返ってみたいと思います。
また、馴れ初めや結婚する前の交際の報道、結婚した後の挙式や子供についても書いてみたいと思います。
菅田将暉と小松菜奈の出会いと交際期間。いつから付き合っていた？ 菅田将暉さんと小松菜奈さんが初めて共演したのは2016年の「ディストラクション・ベイビーズ」です。
撮影は2015年の5月だったので、馴れ初めは菅田将暉さんは22歳、小松菜奈さんは19歳の頃でした。
同年2016年に「溺れるナイフ」でも共演、出会った年に２作続けて共演したということです。
出会った最初から交際に発展したわけではなく、最初は親交関係を深めるだけだったそうです。
特に最初の共演した映画ではほとんど会話はしておらず、2回目の共演の「溺れるナイフ」で仲良くなったようです。
私も先に『ディストラクション・ベイビーズ』で、その後『溺れるナイフ』の撮影で良かったなと思ってます。『溺れるナイフ』では精神的にすごく頼らせていただきました。『ディストラクション・ベイビーズ』のときは現場でほとんど話をすることもなかったんです。でも、『溺れるナイフ』の時は支えてもらわないと生きていけない状態だったので（笑） それに撮影時は19歳だったので、気持ち的にもこのタイミングで『溺れるナイフ』が撮れてよかったなと思います。
菅田さんも小松さんも『ディストラクション・ベイビーズ』から『溺れるナイフ』で再共演した流れが助かったと話しています。
小松さんの方が菅田さんよりも早めに撮影に入ったそうで、かなり精神的にやられ、菅田さんが合流した際に以前の小松さんと違った雰囲気でビックリしたそうです。
ちなみに「溺れるナイフ」で菅田さんが演じた役（コウちゃん）は、小松さんにとってそのままの存在のように感じたそうです。
しかし、菅田さんは出会った当初から小松菜奈さんのことを気にしていたそうです。一方の小松菜奈さんは、菅田さんに直接と”嫌い”と言っていたそうです。
それぞれが「今だから言えること」を発表。前回の舞台あいさつで、劇中、菅田さんに本気で殴られ、逆に本気で蹴ったことを打ち明けた小松さんは、「菅田さんのことが嫌いでした」と衝撃告白。「ただただ暴力を振るわれて、（菅田が演じた）裕也ももちろん嫌いなんですけど菅田さんまで嫌いになった」とか。
引用元：シネマカフェ
セリフを覚えるのに苦労してる小松さんを見かねて、菅田さんは「セリフ一緒にやろうか？」って言ってくれたのに、小松さんは負けず嫌いを発揮し「いや、大丈夫です！」と断ったそうです。
「溺れるナイフ」は小松菜奈にとって仕事も私生活も変えた作品 映画「溺れるナイフ」の撮影ではかなり苦労したという小松菜奈さん。
後のインタビューで、
10代ギリギリの時期でこういう映画に出演できたっていう意味と、山戸監督とお仕事できたっていう意味は自分の中で大きなものだったと思いますね。
と答えており、作品と監督に出会えたことは、女優人生にとってかなり大きかったと語っています。
今となっては、将来の旦那さんになる菅田将暉さんと仲良くなれた作品ということで、私生活も変え、小松さんの人生そのものを変えた俊作だったといえます。
2019年に「niko and…」のCMで再共演、「糸」の撮影で交際スタート 以前に続けて映画で共演するも、交際に至らなかったお二人。
しかし、2019年に「niko and…」のCMで共演する頃には、見事に恋仲になりました。
菅田将暉さんと小松菜名さんが交際を始めたのは2019年の秋です。
つまり2021年の11月に結婚するまで、2年の友人関係＋3年の交際期間があったということになります。かなりバランスの良い数字です。
その頃（2019年）は2020年に公開された共演作「糸」の撮影期間（2019年7月〜9月）で、以前から小松さんに好意を寄せていた菅田さんから猛アタックがあったそうです。
菅田さんが小松菜奈さんに惚れていた理由というのは、
「長らく友人同士だった2人ですが、菅田さんは小松さんの飾らない人柄に以前から好意を寄せていたそうです。小松さんも、何事にもひたむきな菅田さんを尊敬していて本当にお似合いのカップルですよ」
と、小松さんのサバサバしてて飾らない性格が好きだったようです。
ちなみに小松菜奈さんの性格といえば、過去に関西出身のアイドル・小瀧望さんに「関西出身なら、面白いことをしてください」と無茶振りをしたり、かなりドSだと認知されています。
