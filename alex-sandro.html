He only appeared in one Brasileiro game, on October 18, when he faced Internacional. Alex Sandro was a significant component in Atletico’s title drive in 2009, appearing in eight games in the Campeonato Paranaense. He scored his first goal against Rio Branco on January 25th, moving the ball himself around the goalkeeper. As early as October 2009, he has played in nine Brasileiro matches, accumulating 269 minutes.</li><li>In 2010, Santos signed Alex Sandro to a two-year loan deal. Atletico Paranaense sold him to the investors, with Deportivo Maldonado in Uruguay holding the registration rights. Deportivo Maldonado paid Atletico Paranaense R$1,114,000 for secret player transfers, according to the club’s 2010 financial report.</li><li>On July 23, 2011, Alex Sandro was signed by Portuguese Primeira Liga club Porto for €9.6 million from proxy team Deportivo Maldonado. He signed a five-year deal with a €50 million release clause.</li><li>On August 20, 2015, Alex Sandro signed a five-year deal with Italian Serie A champions Juventus. On September 12, 2015, he made his club debut in a 1-1 home draw against Chievo in Serie A. Juventus, the reigning champions, made a disastrous start to the season and were in the bottom half of the standings by late October. The squad launched a comeback that started on October 31 with a last-gasp Turin derby win, with the Brazilian left-back playing a key part.</li><li>Alex Sandro maintained his good form from the previous season despite scoring their own goal in a 3-1 away defeat to Genoa. He ousted incumbent Patrice Evra as the starting left defense after a streak of outstanding performances. The Frenchman moved to Marseille in January 2017.</li><li>Alex Sandro appeared in 43 games this season, 11 more than the previous year. As a consequence, he quickly became one of Massimiliano Allegri’s most reliable players. In terms of statistics, the Brazilian increased his league goalscoring output even further, scoring three times as Juventus won their third straight league and cup double. In his third season at Juventus, Alex Sandro made 39 appearances in all competitions, scoring four goals in 26 league games, all of which came in Serie A; he finished the 2017-18 season with his third straight domestic double with the club.</li><li>Alex Sandro earned his 50th UEFA Champions League appearance on October 23, 2018, in a 1-0 away victory against Manchester United (excluding qualifying rounds). He earned his 100th Serie A appearance for Juventus on March 30, 2019, in a 1-0 home victory against Empoli. On April 2, he made his 150th appearance for Juventus in the club’s next league match, a 2-0 away victory over Cagliari. On April 20, he scored the temporary equalizer as Juventus came from behind to defeat Fiorentina 2-1 at home and win Serie A.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alex-Sandro-1-1-1.webp alt="Alex Sandro" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Alex Sandro’s Net Worth</h2><p>In December 2018, the left defender signed a deal with Juventus for 9.2 million euros (7.9 million pounds) per year.
