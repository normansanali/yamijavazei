His mother was a basketball coach and his father was a boxer who once defeated Ken Norton. Strahan's uncle, Art, played for teams in both the AFL and NFL. His father was in the Army, and the future football star spent a good part of his childhood living in Germany.</p><p>After moving back to the States, Strahan became a star football player in high school and at Texas Southern University. He was drafted by the New York Giants in 1993 and would spend his entire 15-year career with the team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Strahan was building his football career, he was also practicing for a career in the media after his playing days were over. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said during a 2022 appearance</a> on The Pivot Podcast, "I learned to use the media for my benefit in a lot of ways. I wouldn’t answer questions every day, I would tell them I’ll do it two days a week. It wasn’t cause I was mad at them, I just wanted to keep them on their toes."</p><p>Upon his retirement, the former Giants had several opportunities to work on different shows, but he decided to sign with Fox, working on the network's pregame television coverage. He would rapidly climb up the ranks of both football and mainstream media.</p><h2 id=strahan-has-become-a-natural-on-television>Strahan Has Become A Natural On Television</h2><h3 id=the-broadcaster-quickly-rose-up-the-ranks>The broadcaster quickly rose up the ranks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mixcollage-26-feb-2024-10-32-am-6051.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Strahan joined the Fox crew and immediately developed a strong rapport with fellow hosts Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long. Fox had the media star on their football coverage, but other networks were interested in Strahan as well.</p><p>In 2010, the former football player made his first appearance as a guest host alongside <a href=#>Kelly Ripa</a> on Live! with Regis and Kelly. He would go on to guest host 20 times over the next two years. <strong>When Regis Philbin announced that he would be leaving the show in 2012, ABC hired Strahan as his replacement and the program was rebranded Live! With Kelly and Michael.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show was a huge hit and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded impressive ratings numbers</a>. Upon joining up with Ripa, Strahan began making money similar to what he made during his football career. <strong>It was estimated that he was paid $5 million a year to host the show on ABC.</strong>Live! had a strong run with Strahan and Ripa as the hosts, and the duo twice won the Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host.</p><p>The former football player wasn't done climbing the television ladder. In 2016, he left Live! With Micheal and Kelly so that he could move to Good Morning America full-time. He was still working for ABC, but now, he was working for the network's flagship show.</p><p><strong>It is estimated that Strahan makes $17 million per year working on Good Morning America.</strong></p><h2 id=strahan-is-also-an-in-demand-pitchman>Strahan Is Also An In-Demand Pitchman</h2><h3 id=several-companies-have-hired-the-former-giants-39-star-to-rep-their-brands>Several companies have hired the former Giants' star to rep their brands</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/michael-strahan-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same characteristics that make Strahan a good television host also make him a good brand representative, and companies are aware of that.

While Strahan and Hutchins would have two children, the relationship would end in divorce in 1996 before the football player would become especially wealthy.</p><p><strong>Now a single football star living in New York City, Strahan met a woman named Jean Muggli at a local spa. The couple would be married in 1999 and would welcome twins in 2004</strong>. There were issues with the match, though, and the pair would soon separate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The divorce proceedings, which began in 2006, were acrimonious. Muggli accused her husband of infidelity and abuse. <strong>Strahan was eventually ordered to pay his ex-wife $15 million, along with $18,000 a month in alimony.</strong> In addition, the football player was ordered to sell his New Jersey mansion (which sold for $3.6 million) and split the money with his ex-wife.</p><p>After losing so much money in his divorce, it is unlikely that Strahan would look to get married again. <a href=#>Muggli has continued to accuse him</a> of treating his children poorly and not paying back loans. The Good Morning America co-host has now been in a relationship with a woman named Kayla Quick since 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-11t144209-667.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Michael Strahan's Divorce Took An Ugly Turn After His Ex-Wife Claimed He Was A "Financial Burden" With The Kids</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Michael Strahan's ex-wife made some bold claims in court, pointing at Strahan's unpaid debts with the kids.</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtedKtqZqgkaN6rrHSrLBmnJmrvLOvxGalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-strahan-messy-divorce-net-worth.html&text=How%20Michael%20Strahan%27s%20Messy%20Divorce%20Negatively%20Affected%20His%20Once-Impressive%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-strahan-messy-divorce-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-strahan-messy-divorce-net-worth.html&title=How%20Michael%20Strahan%27s%20Messy%20Divorce%20Negatively%20Affected%20His%20Once-Impressive%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-strahan-messy-divorce-net-worth.html&title=How%20Michael%20Strahan%27s%20Messy%20Divorce%20Negatively%20Affected%20His%20Once-Impressive%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-strahan-messy-divorce-net-worth.html&title=How%20Michael%20Strahan%27s%20Messy%20Divorce%20Negatively%20Affected%20His%20Once-Impressive%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-strahan-messy-divorce-net-worth.html&description=How%20Michael%20Strahan%27s%20Messy%20Divorce%20Negatively%20Affected%20His%20Once-Impressive%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-the-dark-knight-paved-the-way-for-oppenheimers-imax-dominance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How The Dark Knight paved the way for Oppenheimers IMAX dominance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./funnymike-girlfriend-jaliyah-monet-arrested.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FunnyMike Girlfriend Jaliyah Monet Arrested: What Did She Do?
