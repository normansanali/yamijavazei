While there have also been a lot of <a href=#>showmances</a> on the CBS reality series since it debuted in 2000, a few Big Brother couples have managed to make their relationships work when the cameras are no longer rolling.</p><p>In addition to the engagements and marriages that have resulted from the show, multiple alum couples have welcomed babies together.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From Rachel Reilly and Brendon Villegas to Nicole Franzel and Victor Arroyo's surprise pregnancy announcement, we've rounded up the most notable cast members who have grown their families after initially meeting on the show.</p><p>Keep reading for the list of <a href=#>Big Brother couples</a> who have had babies together (and to learn what their current relationship statuses are).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Nicole Franzel and Victor Arroyo</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Nicole, who appeared on the show three times, and Victor, who was on once, first locked eyes during Season 18. Their relationship was platonic at first, and the two began dating after their stint on the show. Their romance surprised some fans, as Nicole was viewed as a villain for voting out Ian Terry on Big Brother 22.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Like multiple other couples on this list, Victor and Nicole also appeared as a team on The Amazing Race, and they announced their engagement in 2019. Their 2020 wedding was postponed due to the pandemic.</p><p>The next title they can each add to their resumes is "parent."</p><p>The duo welcomed their son in July 2021.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2.

The two proved the haters wrong, and they continued dating after the show.</p><p>They competed on Season 30 of The Amazing Race together in 2018, and they announced their engagement as the season was airing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By September of that year, Cody and Jessica shared that they were expecting their first child together.

She began dating co-star Jeff Schroeder in 2009, and the two moved to Los Angeles together in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>In a move made for reality TV, Jeff proposed to Jordan in the backyard of the Big Brother house in 2014.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though they originally intended on getting married in the fall of 2016, they pushed their nuptials up to March of that year. Their son, Lawson Keith, was born in October of 2016. Their second son, Layton Sarti, was born in September of 2018.</p><p>The family now lives in Colorado.&nbsp;</p><p>Though most Big Brother competitors enter the house for money or fame, some do walk away with something that is arguably more valuable (and potentially longer-lasting): love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7aoecGrpq2glad6o63Bopys</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbig-brother-babies.html&text=A%20Running%20List%20of%20All%20of%20the%20%27Big%20Brother%27%20USA%20Couples%20Who%20Had%20Babies&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-brother-babies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-brother-babies.html&title=A%20Running%20List%20of%20All%20of%20the%20%27Big%20Brother%27%20USA%20Couples%20Who%20Had%20Babies" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbig-brother-babies.html&title=A%20Running%20List%20of%20All%20of%20the%20%27Big%20Brother%27%20USA%20Couples%20Who%20Had%20Babies" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbig-brother-babies.html&title=A%20Running%20List%20of%20All%20of%20the%20%27Big%20Brother%27%20USA%20Couples%20Who%20Had%20Babies" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-brother-babies.html&description=A%20Running%20List%20of%20All%20of%20the%20%27Big%20Brother%27%20USA%20Couples%20Who%20Had%20Babies" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bee-gees-nights-on-broadway-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bee Gees  Nights On Broadway Lyrics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./not-vegas-quality-detroit-youth-choir-wows-judges-but-agt-all-stars-fans-are-not-impressed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Not Vegas quality': Detroit Youth Choir wows judges but 'AGT: All-Stars' fans are not impressed">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
