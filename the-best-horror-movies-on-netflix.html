The movie is a fantasy, horror, and comedy hybrid. And it is inspired by a classical Basque folktale. Also, the film’s dialogue is in the Basque language, which is very rare for international releases.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=637 data-current-count=955 data-injectable=true>The story follows a government advisor searching for a rebel. Many years previously, this rebel killed all his captors by getting help from a demon and is now believed to be hoarding stolen gold.

While horror lovers may find the movie a little light on scares, the comedy makes up for it, especially as the cast has fantastic on-screen chemistry.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Coming Home in the Dark</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>2021’s&nbsp;Coming Home in the Dark&nbsp;is a psychological thriller from New Zealand.

However, as the kidnapping continues, it is revealed that these two kidnappers may have a link to the family. And this link will uncover some dark truths about the family members and their past deeds.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>A white-knuckle ride from start to finish, this film is a very terrifying experience — not because it is full of monsters or ghouls, but because of how it presents human nature.

The Swarm</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>First released in 2020, this French horror film presents an interesting take on the classic creature feature. It follows single mother Virginie as she attempts to raise locusts as a protein source. However, she can’t get the locusts to breed fast enough, causing her problems and stress. However, when the locusts feed on an open wound, Virginie realizes that her locusts seemingly have a taste for flesh. Virginie starts to feed the locusts her blood and flesh, causing them to multiply quickly, but when they escape, chaos ensues as it turns out these locusts will eat anything — and anyone.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>While there was a risk that this movie could become overly goofy, the filmmakers perfectly nailed the tone, meaning that this film really is horrific. Especially because Virginie’s slow spiral into desperation is played perfectly, giving this film an understandable and relatable core.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-6-crimson-peak data-injectable=false>6. Crimson Peak&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Crimson Peak&nbsp;was a controversial movie when it first came out in 2015, but it quickly generated a cult following. This is to be expected; when Guillermo del Toro directs and co-writes a film, you shouldn’t expect something safe.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Crimson Peak&nbsp;is a gothic horror romance that follows American heiress Edith Cushing, who is visited by her mother’s ghost. This ghost tells her to beware of Crimson Peak. However, when an older Edith falls in love with Sir Thomas Sharpe, she finds herself pulled into a twisted web of murder, suspense, and horror.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Packed full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing,&nbsp;Crimson Peak&nbsp;is a fantastic del Toro film. While not the scariest movie ever made, it still offers an atmospheric experience that calls back to classic gothic horror novels and stories, making it great for viewers who want character and thrills more than scares.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-7-the-platform data-injectable=false>7.

Directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, this Spanish-language film is set in a massive vertical prison. This prison is called The Pit. Inside, the food is delivered via a platform that slowly descends, meaning that while those on the top eat well, those near the bottom struggle. People are randomly reassigned floors every month to keep the prisoners on edge.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>The audience follows Goreng, a prisoner who tries to understand the structure, but all he discovers is suffering, pain, and intense violence as he struggles to survive in these hellish conditions.

Vampires vs. the Bronx</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Directed by Oz Rodriguez and written by Rodriguez and Blaise Hemingway,&nbsp;Vampires vs. the Bronx, as the title suggests, finds a group of Bronx locals battle against a group of vampires who plan to take over the area. However, in a delightfully modern twist, the vampires’ biggest weapon isn’t fangs or dark magic but rather gentrification as the vampires are buying up property all over town, literally and spiritually forcing the Bronx natives out of the area.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>A horror comedy that draws heavily from 1980s horror genre films,&nbsp;Vampires v. the Bronx&nbsp;is memorable, funny, and stylish. It effortlessly blends its social commentary with comedy and horror tropes without any part feeling half-baked or extraneous. This is the perfect film for viewers who want their horror to be low on scares but full of biting social commentary.</p><h2 id=h-9-the-babysitter data-injectable=false>9. The Babysitter&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>2017’s&nbsp;The Babysitter&nbsp;was overlooked on release, but quickly became a cult classic thanks to its unique plot and stylish direction.

Cole’s babysitter, Bee, stands up for him; however, when Cole learns that Bee is part of an evil cult, he must do his best to discover the truth about the cult and survive the night in this inventive and fun movie that blends an old-school slasher movie with some hilarious dark comedy. Samara Weaving’s portrayal of Bee is the highlight as she perfectly merges evil, stylish, and relatable, creating a character that will stick in your memory for a long time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-10-apostle data-injectable=false>10. Apostle&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Gareth Evans can seemingly do no wrong as a director. No matter what he creates, it turns out well, and 2018’s&nbsp;Apostle&nbsp;is a stunning horror movie that proves Evans can handle visual flare just as well as intense action.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Set on a remote Welsh island in 1905, the film follows Thomas Richardson as he attempts to infiltrate the cult that has kidnapped his sister.

After a storm wrecks her boat, Jennifer Remming washes up on a desert island. Alas, Jennifer’s travel partner Brad doesn’t survive the crash, and Jennifer has to bury him on the beach. But, after finding some other graves on the island, Jennifer returns to find that Brad’s grave is uncovered and the body is gone. To make matters worse, Jennifer soon learns that the island is much more dangerous than it first appears.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Kiersey Clemons’ performance really carries this movie, as she perfectly captures Jennifer’s fear, confusion, and overall drive to survive whatever this strange island throws at her.&nbsp;Sweetheart&nbsp;is a fantastic movie with a rather unique premise that needs to be seen to be believed.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-12-creep data-injectable=false>12.
