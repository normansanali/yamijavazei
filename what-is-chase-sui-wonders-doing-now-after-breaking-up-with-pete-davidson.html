Sadly, the two broke up in August 2023, and Wonders has joined the long <a href=#>list of Davdison's exes like Ariana Grande and Kim Kardashian</a>. From the interviews that she gave, it sounded like she was excited about their relationship. That must make the heartbreak even worse.</p><p>In the months since she and Pete Davidson said goodbye to each other, Chase Sui Wonders has definitely been living her best life. Here's what she has been up to and whether she made any big changes to her life now that she is on her own again.</p><h2 id=why-did-chase-sui-wonders-and-pete-davidson-split-up>Why Did Chase Sui Wonders And Pete Davidson Split Up?</h2><p>In August 2023, People reported on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chase Sui Wonders and Pete Davidson breakup</a>. They had been together for nine months. The publication noted that he was going to rehab because of his borderline personality disorder and PTSD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Wonders and Davidson never explained the reason for the end of their relationship, they did experience one difficult moment. People reported that in March 2023, the pair had a car accident and ran into a fire hydrant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-pete-davidson-bodies-bodies-bodies.png><p>A source explained to People of Davidson, "He's single again. He's out and about and doing really well."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Pete Davidson Really As Rich As We Thought? (Probably Not)</a></span></p><p>Another source told Entertainment Tonight, “Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders have broken up and both of them are focusing on themselves.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bodies-bodies-bodies-pete-davidson.jpg><p>In the past few months, Davidson has been fairly quiet. In the past, when he and a partner broke up, it wouldn't be very long before he started dating someone else.</p><p>According to Page Six, he and Kim Kardashian dated from November 2021 to August 2022. He started a relationship with Emily Ratajkowski in November 2022. After that, he started seeing Chase Sui Wonders. As of this writing, he doesn't seem to be dating anyone new, though.</p><h2 id=what-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now>What Is Chase Sui Wonders Doing Now?</h2><p>It was fun to watch Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders co-star in the horror movie Bodies Bodies Bodies, which was released in March 2022. In fact, the actors played a couple named David and Emma.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chase-sui-city-on-fire-premiere.jpg><p>As they hang out in a big house in the country with their friend group and someone dies, it becomes clear that David and Emma have some relationship problems. They had a lot of chemistry in all of their scenes together.</p><p>After Wonders and Davidson broke up, Wonders shared a photo on her Instagram account on August 28, 2023, according to The Daily Mail. She was on vacation and seemed happy and relaxed. While of course fans can guess that both actors were upset by the breakup, she definitely looked great.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chase-sui-wonders-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Wonders has been getting out and having fun. She attended the Proenza Schouler show at New York Fashion Week in September 2023. She posted a photo from her front row seat on Instagram and fans were excited to see that she was with Molly Gordon, The Bear star Ayo Edebiri, her Bodies Bodies Bodies co-star Rachel Sennott, and Emma Seligman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Childhood Disorder Took Away Chase Sui Wonders' Voice For Years Before She Was Famous</a></span></p><p>In mid-September 2023, Wonders posted on Instagram that she attended an event for "Sofia Coppola Archive: 1999-2023," the book that Sofia Coppola is currently promoting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chase-sui-wonders-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for whether the actress is dating again, there are no reports that she has someone new in her life. She might be keeping that quiet, or she might still be single.</p><p>Chase Sui Wonders's life definitely looks different right now since actors aren't filming any projects because of the WGA/SAF-AFTRA strike that began on May 2nd, 2023. She also isn't able to give interviews where she is promoting anything that has recently been released.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Chase Sui Wonders Was Discovered By Sofia Coppola</a></span></p><p>Besides that, it seems that Wonders is still living in New York City, which she has been for a while. In April 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chloe Fineman and Chase Sui Wonders chatted</a> for Interview Magazine and Wonders shared that she had an apartment in the East Village. She joked about how everyone living there was very young and that she wasn't sure that she fit in anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/did-chase-sui-wonders-net-worth-explode-as-soon-as-she-started-dating-pete-davidson_-here-s-the-truth-about-her-career.jpg><p>Wonders also mentioned that she was writing for TV, which is interesting. She said, "I’m just getting back into town, getting my life in order. I’m writing today. I’ve been working on this TV script for a while. We’re trying to push it across the finish line and get all the kinks out."</p><p>Wonders hasn't shared any more information about her writing. It's possible that she is still in the midst of the creative process and there haven't been any updates to share. Of course, with the ongoing strike, no TV show or movie deals or being made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chase-sui-wonders.jpg><p>While she hasn't explained how she is spending her time now that she is no longer dating Pete Davidson, Chase Sui Wonders has always been super creative. In 2021, she said in an interview with W Magazine that when she lived with her mom at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, she did a lot of drawing.</p><p>Wonders said, "Even if I didn’t do anything all day, I would make an attempt to draw because even as quiet and mundane and maddening as that time was, drawing taps into a meditative state,” she said.</p><p>“It’s such a quiet and calm act and not always stimulating, but I tap into a state where I’m spending time and attention doing something and it feels like a recharge. You can just laser your focus in on something creative. I definitely turn to it as a coping mechanism.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chase-sui-wonders-pete-davidson-bodies-bodies-bodies-01-700x400-1.jpg><p>Chase Sui Wonders isn't able to do any more promotion for her latest TV shows Bupkis, which also stars Pete Davidson, or City on Fire. Her next project is a movie called Little Death that also stars Jena Malone and David Schwimmer. According to the movie's IMDb page, it's currently in post-production. Whenever the strike ends, it seems likely that Little Death will be released, and fans will be glad to see Wonders star in this film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKhmKydXajCqnnWqKWdnaKoeqW7yKeeZqafrHqistOeqWaaopqurLXNoGSuqF2strW0jKmcrZ1dma63tcOspqdn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html&text=Has%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Completely%20Changed%20Her%20Life%20After%20Breaking%20Up%20With%20Pete%20Davidson%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html&title=Has%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Completely%20Changed%20Her%20Life%20After%20Breaking%20Up%20With%20Pete%20Davidson%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html&title=Has%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Completely%20Changed%20Her%20Life%20After%20Breaking%20Up%20With%20Pete%20Davidson%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html&title=Has%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Completely%20Changed%20Her%20Life%20After%20Breaking%20Up%20With%20Pete%20Davidson%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html&description=Has%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Completely%20Changed%20Her%20Life%20After%20Breaking%20Up%20With%20Pete%20Davidson%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hendrick-automotive-opens-bmw-dealership-south-charlotte.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hendrick Automotive opens BMW dealership in south Charlotte  WSOC TV">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gregory-lemond-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gregory LeMond Net Worth [2023 Update] | Life &amp;amp; House">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
